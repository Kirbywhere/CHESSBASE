{Tired of playing the same old openings? Bored with stuffy opening theory?
This book provides a welcome antidote! --- Former American Open Champion Cyrus
Lakdawala presents a range of vicious weapons for White in a repertoire which
is perfect for those who have little time for study, but enjoy taking
opponents out of their comfort zones and causing them problems from the very
beginning. --- The repertoire's backbone is provided by the aggressive Veresov
Opening (} 1. d4 -- 2. Nc3 {and 3 Bg5) and this weapon is accompanied by
equally hostile options against other Black tries such as the French,
Caro-Kann, Dutch, Benoni, Pirc and Philidor. These weapons are ideal choices
for those who revel in forcing opponents into chaotic, uncomfortable positions.
} -- {Opening weapons to shock and confound opponents; Covers all of Black's
main defences; Includes game summaries with key points to remember.} (2... -- {
Cyrus Lakdawala is an International Master, a former National Open and
American Open Champion, and a six-time State Champion. He has been teaching

{This book is really the result of a happy accident. I had just finished my
first book for Everyman Chess on the London System, when John Emms asked if I
wanted to do a second book - on the Veresov. Apparently he had seen several of
my games with the Veresov in the database. There was only one problem: John
had been looking at my younger brother Jimmy's games! The database had
inadvertently posted many of Jimmy's games under my name. Jimmy had played the
Veresov in the 80's and had long since retired from tournament play to become
a captain of industry, running our family business. I, on the other hand, had
not played a single Veresov in my life. After confessing this to John he gave
me the go ahead anyway. Perhaps John thought Veresov was in the Lakdawala
family genes! --- The book constituted a real challenge, and the irony of a
London-loving chess chicken like me writing a book on one of the most
bloodthirsty openings in chess was not lost on me. I had always considered the
Veresov an opening of dubious lineage. After all, with} 1. d4 -- {and} 2. Nc3 {
, White violates one of the biggest taboos in chess, which is don't block your
c-pawn with your knight in a Queen's Pawn opening. What never occurs to
Veresov naysayers is the fact that White isn't trying for c4, but instead
plays for e4! Diehard Veresovers like Jimmy knew better. He would heap poetic
praises upon his beloved opening. Not wishing to hurt the lad's feelings, I
indulged him by nodding politely, coughing, looking up at the ceiling and
whistling through my teeth, holding back any criticism of his favourite
opening. Now, having thoroughly studied the opening, I can state with confidence
that Jimmy was right and I was wrong. The Veresov is completely playable, and
if you are a tactician and attacking player, it tends to suck your opponent
into your realm of power. Nobody bothers to study the line as Black. So the
greatest strength of the Veresov is its own dubious reputation!} -- (2... -- {
Profile of a Veresover: Jimmy was born to play the Veresov: -- 1. He was
incredibly lazy about opening study. In fact, he reached an impressive US
Chess Federation rating just over 2400 without ever studying a single chess
book! A feat only the young Capa matched. The opening is easy to learn because
you play d4, Nc3, Bg5 and often f3 against just about everything. The idea
behind the opening is incredibly simple: force e4! no matter how Black
responds. This one guiding principle makes your opening choices easy. -- 2. He
was lopsided in his chess abilities. I would estimate his strategic understanding at the level of a typical kindergartener, while his tactical and calculation
abilities were right in the neighbourhood of Rybka! Once at a family birthday
party I was playing GM Kaidanov in a 5-0 game on the ICC. Jimmy came in late,
looked at the position for about 20 seconds and stopped me from making the
move I was going to play. He reeled off a long variation with a cheapo at the
end and insisted I play it. Kaidanov walked right into it! -- 3. Jimmy was
happiest when the position was a mess. The more unclear the position, the
better. And with the Veresov that's what you get. --- So if you have any of
the following similar traits, then the Veresov is a perfect opening choice:
you don't have much time or inclination for study; you are a natural tactician;
and you revel in chaotic positions.}) (2... -- {A History of the Veresov:
Besides Jimmy, the other founding fathers of the opening were Savielly
Tartakower, who invented the line in the 1920's and played it his entire life;
Kurt Richter, who played it mostly in the 30's; and Gavril Veresov, who played
it from the 30's to the mid-70's. Gavril Veresov must have had the better
press agent for the opening to be named after him. Its pedigree includes four
World Champions who employed it: Smyslov, Tal, Spassky and Karpov. The top GMs
who play it today are Hector and Khachian.}) (2... -- {The Tone of this Book:
I hope the reader will forgive my occasional overly-goofy tone. In the middle
of a chapter, I may suddenly engage you in a conversation about the Borg
Collective and go on to confess impure thoughts towards space goddess
Sevenofnine! The idea is to recreate the casual atmosphere of chess lessons at
my home rather than that of a professor in a lecture hall. It's actually a
mystery to me why most chess books are so formally written, as if readers are
Amish elders rather than the goofs and nerds most of us are! Besides, I can't
help it. The dangerous combination of Jimi Hendrix and Buddhist chants
blasting away on the CD player while I write induces such outbursts! I hope
the reader gets as much enjoyment reading this book as I did writing it.}) (
2... -- {Acknowledgments: No project this large gets produced by a single
individual without the helping kindness of others. I would like to thank John
Emms for his Capa-like clarity with the chapter outlines, and also for
allowing me to write the book the way I did. Thanks to Richard Palliser for
his final edit of the book. Thanks to my friends Dave Hart and Peter Graves
for their helpful discussions and suggestions while the book was in progress.
Thanks to proof-reader-in-chief Nancy, and to computer wiz Timothy (I would
like to add that any lingering resentment over the fact that the damned fool
accidentally deleted a full day's work in Chapter Six has dissolved in the fog
of time!).}) (2... -- {Cyrus Lakdawala, San Diego, November 2010.}) *

1. d4 Nf6 2. Nc3 d5 3. Bg5 Nbd7 4. f3 $5 {. If you decide to play the 4 f3!?
Veresov, be prepared to enter the rabbit hole. The lines in this chapter are
the craziest and some would claim most unsound of the entire Veresov. And
indeed, there are several lines which are flat out unsound. I tried to weed
these out and place them at a safe distance in the notes! Don't worry though.
If you don't like the positions from this chapter, you always have the option
of skipping the lines here and heading to the solidity of 4 Qd3 in Chapter Two.
} -- (4... -- {Key ideas to remember: -- 1. The first two games
(Réti-Tartakower and Khachian-Kostin) deal with Black's worst option, which is
the French-like situations arising from the ...e6 lines. The trouble for Black
is that he already committed his knight to d7, and everyone knows that the
b8-knight should be developed to c6 in a French. -- 2. Khachian-Donchenko is
an example of the ...c5 lines, usually played on Black's fourth move. Here I
recommend taking on c5 and holding on for dear life, usually with b4. Black
normally regains the pawn due to his development lead and the arising
positions are interesting battles between White's big queenside pawn majority
and Black's central advance.}) ({3. The position after} 4... c6 5. e4 dxe4 6.
fxe4 e5 7. Nf3 {reveals the big problem with playing 4 f3. The recipe for
Black (often given as a refutation of the Veresov itself) is the set-up ...Nbd7, ...c6, and when White plays e4, capture on e4 and hit back with a timely
...e5!. Structurally White remains pretty shaky in these lines and he is often
forced to part with his powerful dark-squared bishop. I tried to thread the
needle, and feel that the lines recommended here are the only playable options
for White who gets activity, a development lead and attacking chances to
compensate for some of his positional failings. Yilmazyerli-Song is a good
example of White's explosive potential in this line. -- 4. Warning: This line
is reserved for the very bravest of you out there! The 7 Nf3 line, as here, is
your wildest option in the whole 4 f3 Veresov. White gives up structure,
taking on an isolani on e4, and sometimes even gives up his b-pawn to boot.
But don't despair. You get quite a bit in return in the form of tremendous
piece activity, open files and real attacking chances. Here you just plunge
into the ocean and either get the pearl or drown!}) *

player. Compare our line to the Fantasy Variation of the Caro-Kann: 1 e4 c6 2
d4 d5 3 f3 dxe4 4 fxe4 e5 5 Nf3. Let's see what White gets and what he must
give up in the 7 Nf3 line of the Veresov: -- 1. White allows damage to his
pawn structure, isolating his e-pawn and creating a hole on e5. -- 2. White
often must sac his b-pawn to some form of ...Qb6 and ...Qxb2. -- 3. White gets
the open f-file for his attack. This in conjunction with Bc4 and a timely e5
could be deadly for Black, who could implode on f7. -- 4. White in general
gets great piece activity, with a powerful bishop on c4, potentials of Nd4 and
Nf5, and play along the f-file, d-file or b-file if White has sac'ed his
b-pawn. -- 5. You will probably lose most endings if you get there without
doing some damage to Black but as Tarrasch once said: "Before the endgame the

1. d4 Nf6 2. Nc3 d5 3. Bg5 e6 4. e4 {. Many of your opponents just don't want
to deal with the main lines of the Veresov and will sidestep them, choosing to
transpose into other openings. The most common switch is to French lines with ...Nf6. In 2010, so far I have played nine Veresovs over the board and six of
them turned into French ...Nf6 lines! That's a pretty high percentage, so this
is quite an important chapter for those of you keen to take up the Veresov.
--- We reach the French via 1 d4 Nf6 2 Nc3 d5 3 Bg5 and at this point, your
opponent begins to get cold feet, realizing he doesn't know a thing about the
Veresov and impulsively he responds with 3...e6 4 e4, and lo and behold, we
have the French. The really wonderful benefit for you is that about 80% of
your opposition will be unfamiliar with the black side of the French! This is
not an opening conducive to groping in the dark and winging it! --- After 4 e4
Black chooses among the following:} -- (4... dxe4 {brings us to Rubinstein
French lines with Black committed to ...Nf6 and White to Bg5. Black hopes the
insertion of the move pair favours him since he may get freeing trades with
the bishop already posted on g5. After} 5. Nxe4 Be7 {we chop the knight with}
6. Bxf6 {to maintain our outpost on e4, leaving Black with a further choice:}
Bxf6 {is the solid choice. Black gets the bishop pair and hopes to hit back in
the centre with ...c5. Even when he does manage it, White's development tends
to mean more than Black's bishop pair. Your extra space gives you attacking
chances, especially if you decide to castle queenside.} (6... gxf6 $5 {
is a super-aggressive option once played by Gurevich on Kasparov. Black agrees
to the slight damage to his pawn structure, but in return he gets control over
e5 and doesn't give White the option to take the bishop on f6. White's best
line is to fianchetto and fight for control over d5.})) ({

. Now I recommend the Alekhine-Chatard Gambit with} 6. h4 $5 {. It scores very
well for White who gets a long-lasting initiative for only one pawn. Black can
accept the pawn and try to ride out the storm, but more often than not he gets
capsized by the turbulence. Black can also choose to decline the gambit, but
even in the declined lines, Black has no easy path to equality.}) ({With} 4...

opponents will play, as in Lakdawala-Sevilliano. We go into a delayed Exchange
French and deny Black his favourite set-ups. Black's bishop isn't so well
placed on b4 in the Exchange lines. He will either have to take on c3,
weakening his dark squares, or retreat the bishop later, losing a tempo.} (5...

the ICC in 1998, and in the greatest fluke in all of sports history managed to

for an ICC blitz match versus GM Peter Svidler. He used the account 'Dahlia',
while I was on an account called 'Bodhiboy'. After he smoothly won the first
game, the second petered out to a draw. Kasparov flagged in our final game in
a totally winning rook and pawn ending after declining a draw offer. My friend,
the late GM Tony Miles, was the only other ICC player to break even with the
World Champion that day and I believe Tony's sole win came when he flagged
Kasparov in a drawn position! David Bowie described it best when he sang: "We
can be heroes, just for one day!" Had I known my opponent's identity, it would
be a pretty safe bet that I would have quivered like large bowl of jelly and

to be compromised, hoping he is compensated by the extra central control and
the bishop pair. White's best line is to fianchetto and take aim at the d5

square.} 1-0

{Do you have a boogieman in chess? Mine is one of the strongest IMs in the
world, the 2008 US Open Champion Enrico Sevilliano. My dismal lifetime score
before this game was four losses and about 12 draws, despite four or five
winning positions. Even more disconcerting is the fact that Sevilliano's
amiable personality and thug-like chess style don't match at all. Playing
Enrico is exactly like having your mild-mannered and soft-spoken neighbour
drop in for a cup of tea, and then immediately after the tea, put a knife to

1. d4 d5 2. Nc3 e6 3. e4 {. We cover four critical French lines in this
chapter arising from the move order 1 d4 d5 2 Nc3 e6 3 e4. The only difference
from Chapter Four is that Black hasn't committed to an early ...Nf6:} -- ({
After} 3... Bb4 {we have the Winawer Variation. Now, if you already know and
enjoy the main lines of the Winawer, then by all means go into these. However,
for the rest of us it may be easier not to commit to such a huge effort in
learning so much theory. Let's circumvent the main lines against the Winawer,
which your opponents undoubtedly want you to play, and instead begin
'Operation Annoy The French Player' by playing the delayed Exchange French.
The positions will be similar to the Lasker line we play versus McCutcheon,
but possibly even better for White. My feeling is that Black's bishop is
misplaced at b4 and he really wants it posted on d6 or e7. On b4 Black will
either exchange for your knight on c3, giving you the dark squares in exchange
for a slight weakening of your pawn structure, or lose a tempo and retreat the
bishop later. If Black retreats, remember the manoeuvre Nce2! and transfer the
knight over to the king's wing for a build up to your attack.}) ({

committed our bishop to g5, as in Chapter Four which usually leads to freeing

his c-pawn, mimicking us, and playing his own knight to c6. Let's be
consistent and deal with it by playing a delayed Exchange. I used to play this
line as Black, but pretty much gave it up because I hated the lifeless
positions I got after the exchange on d5. White is up a move in a symmetrical
position and that has to be worth something. If anything, you make Black sweat
to equalize.}) *

Summary: Yes, I know. This game was teeming with blunders. One of the charms
of the Veresov I have grown to love is its disorienting nature (hopefully just
for your opponent!). In this game both players drifted and missed thematic
ideas. This will occasionally happen to you too (Lord knows it happens to me
all the time!). When it does, just embrace the chaos and stay aggressive. The
longer you play the Veresov, the less crazy it gets.}) 1-0

{I had the honour of playing the great Mikhail Botvinnik in a simul in
Montreal when I was 15-years old. I plotted with my friend, Andy, another
junior who also played the legend. We grudgingly conceded Botvinnik had an
edge over us strategically, but he was weak (for a World Champion!) tactically,
and that we both had excellent chances to whip him should complications arise!
We had unearthed his Achilles heel and were ready to strike! Oh, the innocence
of youth. --- In the game, by some miracle I managed to outplay Botvinnik
strategically on the black side of a King's Indian and reduce him to moving
back and forth. I was so close to the win that I visualized the headlines in
the following day's newspaper: 'Boy Genius Defeats 3-Time World Champ!!!'
Tragically my fantasy world disintegrated quickly when Botvinnik unexpectedly
sac'ed a piece (rather unsoundly), confusing the living daylights out of me,
and swindled me of the point. Could it be that Andy and I maybe needed to
reassess our theory about Botvinnik the tactical weakling?} 1. d4 g6 2. Nc3 d5

{You have a choice against Black's offer of a Caro-Kann, which normally arises
after the move order} 1. d4 d5 2. Nc3 c6 {:} 3. -- ({Simply play} 3. e4 {
and go into a mainline Caro. The potential for trouble with this approach may
be that your opponent probably knows Caro lines better than you do since it is
his bread and butter opening. Now if you play Caro as Black, or just tend to
do well when you are White against Caro and know it well, then take this route.
}) ({You obstinately force the game into Veresov paths with} 3. Bg5 $5 {
. I remember when FM Duckworth played this on me, the move came as a real
shock. I realized that I had not avoided the Veresov after all, and as a Caro
player would definitely have preferred him to enter mainlines of the Caro-Kann.
--- In this line with 3 Bg5!? you follow up with e3 and f4 leading to a
strange Reversed Stonewall Dutch, but with a few twists in your favour. Here
is what you get in your Stonewall: -- 1. Your bishop is on the outside of the
chain on g5 instead of on c1. -- 2. Black doesn't know you are about to play a
Stonewall and often replies with the passive ...Nd7. It would be better for
your opponent to later post his knight on c6 (after playing ...c5 of course;
as far as I know, two pieces can't share the same square!) where it would put
more pressure on your centre. -- 3. ...c6 probably costs him a tempo since at
some later stage Black needs to play ...c5. -- 4. Your knight is on c3, which
is a bit odd. The typical placement would be d2. In the games I researched, I
didn't see any big problem for White with the c3 placement other than the
danger of pins with ...Bb4, but these seem to be easily avoided. The other
problem could be that you don't have a c-pawn backing up d4 and Black uses
this to add pressure on d4. --- Conclusion: I think you get more benefits than
problems as White in this line when we compare it to the normal Stonewall
set-up.}) *

1. d4 d5 2. Nc3 c6 {FM Mark Duckworth and I are often associated with the
demeaning and derogatory term 'Quickplay Expert'. Translation: These players
possess some natural tactical talent, but due to laziness and their shallow
understanding of the game, they only survive in games with low clocks where
they swindle their honest opponents! Hikaru Nakamura once went off on a tirade
on me on ICC when he was losing a 5-0 game (normally I am his punching bag on
ICC). He kibbed the following to onlookers: "I don't know any other player who
plays like a strong GM on ICC, but has such weak results OTB besides 'Kawas'!"
My friend, National Master David Hart, saw the kib and told me: "I guess the
irony of Nakamura's own 'Quickplay Expert' status was lost on him!" --- But I
digress. Where was I? Oh, yes, back to Duckworth. We were tied for first place
in the 1998 US G/60 Championship. All the other titled players were safely out
of the way and it came down to the two of us 'Quickplay Experts'. Besides my
kid brother Jimmy, nobody else had ever ventured a Veresov on me. I used my
standard anti-Jimmy formula of dodging mainlines and going directly to the
French or Caro-Kann, where I was sure to outbook the streetsmart Duckworth.

planned on castling queenside anyway. Also, I sincerely apologize to the
reader for this '0-1' outrage, and promise to work hard to pepper the
remainder of the book with '1-0' games! As I was working on Chapter Six, my
son Tim walked by and asked: "Hey dad, why does White win all the games in
your book?" I calmly replied: "Death to Black!" He gave me the trying look of
a dutiful son who endures the irrational meanderings of a senile parent.} 0-1

1. d4 f5 2. Nc3 {. Unlike some of the earlier chapters in this book where your
author suggests some of the more dubious Veresov lines with a distinctively
apologetic tone, in this chapter I can confidently tell you that the Veresov
is one of the best methods of meeting Dutch. With 2 Nc3! our goal is simple:
blast open with e4! When it happens, Black often finds himself unprepared and
behind in development. Dutch players have three choices:} -- ({
Black meets the Veresov approach with a Stonewall Dutch Structure,} 2... Nf6 3.
Bg5 d5 {, when our plan of Qd2, f3 and playing for e4 looks effective.}) ({

fxe4 5. Nxe4 {Black falls behind in space and development. I suggest a
promising pawn sac line where White stands better whether Black accepts or
declines.}) ({
Black meets the Veresov with a Leningrad Dutch/Stonewall hybrid formation,} 
2... d5 3. Bg5 g6 {. Black's problem is, he really doesn't want to play ...d5,
but he must. Otherwise, White has the killer idea h4-h5!, sac the exchange on
h5 and follow with e4! This gives White a murderous attack, so Black is
virtually forced into the weakening ...d5 move. Our normal plan f3, Qd2,
possibly castle queenside, and force e4 also works very well here. Another
wonderful benefit is that Leningrad players are prodded into a Stonewall
structure, which they are not used to and usually bungle with great
consistency!}) *

that anyone can try to prove anything that suits them by offering up the

Modern/Pirc experts all offer terrifying warnings about the Byrne System to

dangerous at White's disposal, yet it tends to crop up surprisingly little in
practice." Alburt and Chernin call it the "real tiger of the Pirc." And
speaking of tigers, Tiger Hillarp Persson calls it "one of the most poisonous
against the Pirc", but claims Black is okay against it in the Modern. If the
system makes the top GMs of the line this nervous, it is a good bet the Byrne

{Not all chess geniuses are Grandmasters. Genrikh Chepukaitis, also known as
'Smartchip' on ICC, was a legendary blitz player, who, back in the 70's won
the 5-minute championship of Leningrad ahead of Korchnoi and Petrosian. He
could easily have annexed the GM title had he had the inclination. But
Chepukaitis was a true amateur, who played only for the love of the game. I
had the pleasure of many wild encounters over the ICC against the blitz giant
despite my great exertions to keep things dull! So intense was his fighting
spirit that he never ever took draws and to my exasperation, played until bare
kings remained! I never knew who I was playing until it was announced that he
had passed away. It was shocking news to me since I assumed Smartchip was some
teenage hotshot GM incognito. He certainly never played chess like a senior
citizen! I remember my friend, IM David Vigorito, aka 'Fluffy', bitterly

{As I write this, India's beloved son, Anand, faces the much-despised Topalov
for the World Championship title. IM Jack Peters recently sent all the titled
players in Southern California a poll asking who would win the match.
Logically, I felt Topalov must have the edge due to his youth. As I typed my
e-mail response to Jack, I found my fingers typing the following on their on
volition: "Hi Jack, Anand by a point! Best wishes, Cy." As a card-carrying
member of the COA (Church of Anand) there is no way I am going to vote against

vulnerable to h4 ideas; -- 3. White plays a knight to e2 and then prises open

concession no matter which way he blocks the check. White can count on these
factors for an edge: -- 1. The d5-pawn offers more space. -- 2. You are a move
up over the normal Benoni since you didn't waste a tempo on c4. -- 3. Unlike a
normal Benoni, Black has yet to play ...e6. Doing so may make his d6-pawn
vulnerable. -- 4. White's e5 break looks more potent than Black's ...b5 break,
which often doesn't do much to worry White. -- 5. White's extra central space
may translate into a kingside attack with simple moves like Bf4, Qd2 and Bh6.
-- 6. Black often has a problem of what to do with his c8-bishop and sometimes
plays ...Bg4 and ...Bxf3. This hands White the bishop pair.}) ({
Instead, the Czech Benoni,} 1... c5 2. d5 e5 3. e4 d6 {, is a bit like the
Fort Knox of the Benoni set-ups. --- Black hopes his solid but passive central
pawn-wall will lead him into a protracted manoeuvring game. White again has
space and Black has deprived himself of both the ...e6 and ...c6 pawn breaks.
This leaves only the ...f5 break at his disposal. White can either play for f4
with ambitions on the kingside, or just build up on the queenside with moves
like a4 and later a5, followed by b4 at some point. This isn't the most
intimidating set-up for Black, but he hopes to suck you into a long, drawn-out
affair. Have faith in your space! It isn't so easy to play Black in such a
passive position.}) *

his e-pawn for White's c-pawn. This creates queenside versus kingside pawn
majorities and a potentially sharper game. In the Schmid Benoni, the structure
remains more symmetrical with White holding more space due to his d5 wedge. --

effective e5 pawn break while Black plays for the ...b5 break; -- 4. Black

Black plays ...e6, White must make a crucial decision to capture on e6, which

Watson and I analysed a game I had just lost to GM Chernin at the National

the very first hypermodern. In his day, everyone automatically responded to 1 e4 with 1...e5 and 1 d4 classically with 1...d5. With Owen's Defence, Black,
