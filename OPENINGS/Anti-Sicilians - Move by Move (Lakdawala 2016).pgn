Bycontinually challenging the reader to answer probing questions throughout thebook, the Move by Move format greatly encourages the learning and practisingof vital skills just as much as the traditional assimilation of openingknowledge. Carefully selected questions and answers are designed to keep youactively involved and allow you to monitor your progress as you learn. This isan excellent way to study any chess opening and at the same time improve yourgeneral chess skills and knowledge.} 1. -- {Anyone who plays the SicilianDefence as Black must be prepared to meet a whole host of options for Whiteknown as the Anti-Sicilians. These includes popular choices such as thec3-Sicilian, the Grand Prix Attack, the Closed Sicilian, the King's IndianAttack and all Bb5 lines, as well as numerous gambits and tricky sidelineswhich can be very difficult to meet for the unwary player. In this book,International Master Cyrus Lakdawala examines the Anti-Sicilian lines andprovides repertoire options for Black against all of them. Using illustrativegames, he explains the positional and tactical ideas for both sides,highlights important move-order issues and provides answers to all the keyquestions. This book tells you everything you need to know about facing theAnti-Sicilians with Black.} (1. -- {Cyrus Lakdawala is an International Master,a former National Open and American Open Champion, and a six-time StateChampion.

Virtually 90% of myopponents responded to my 1...c5 with Open Sicilians, at least at my D-E levelof play. As the years went by, this number continued to decrease, until today,I will bet that half the time you respond to 1 e4 with 1...c5, your opponentsdodge the Open Sicilian, and opt for some version of an Anti-Sicilian. Now whywould they do this? For several reasons:} (1. -- {1. We chess players live ina society of records and stored data. Make a new move - even accidentally- and somebody, somewhere, records it. These days new opening ideas travelalmost instantly into the collective consciousness, laden with the latest andnewest ideas. This can be a burden, since we are in a never-ending task ofkeeping up with the latest TN. Every time I manage to remember a long stringof opening theory over the board, it reminds me of the end of the children'salphabet song: "Now I know my ABC's, next time won't you sing with me?" Asthe decades roll on, we face information overload. --- If you play an OpenSicilian as White, there is a staggering load of data you must memorize andunderstand. If the opponent is a Dragon player, he or she obsessively studiesthe lines until move 23. Dragon players are far less likely to study the GrandPrix Attack or Closed Sicilian with the same degree of passion. So White ismotivated to dodge our area of expertise. A substantial proportion of playersdecide they don't want to invest energy and time into a knife-edge OpenSicilian, a place where a favourite line can be rendered instantly obsolete bythe finding of a single new idea for Black.}) (1. -- {2. In an Open Sicilian,you as Black, get to pick if the game will be a Dragon, a Najdorf, a Kan, etc.When White plays the Anti-Sicilian, it is he or she who decides whether toplay a King's Indian Attack, or c3-Sicilian.}) (1. -- {3. If White studies,let's say the c3-Sicilian, there are only a few lines he needs to cover andstudy. Not so with Open Sicilians, where he must be ready for the Najdorf,Dragon, Kan, et al and ad nauseam! So in a sense, the Anti-Sicilians are kindof a lazy Sicilian, easy to study and easy to play - with far lesslikelihood for White to get theoretically ambushed.}) (1. -- {4. When youfirst learn how to drive a car, every step must be thought about. A decadelater, our driving is completely automatized (pun intended), and instinctual,where we can be daydreaming and still reach our destination in relative safety.Now if you play Dragon for 10 years, you just have a feel for it, from sheervolume of experience. Essentially, we become lab rats who memorized the routeto the cheese. When White plays an Anti-Sicilian like a b3-Sicilian, itdoesn't matter how long we as Black studied it. We simply won't know andunderstand its subtleties to the same degree as we do the Dragon. So Whiteremoves our experiential advantage - our feel for the line - from theequation.}) *[Event "?"][Site "?"][Date "????.??.??"][Round "?"][White "Handling the Anti-Sicilians"][Black "?"][Result "*"][Annotator "Cyrus Lakdawala"][PlyCount "1"][Source "Everyman Chess"][SourceDate "2016.03.01"]{A book is a theoretical entity, while our over-the-board battle is a directexperience of its practical application. Now how do we deal with these myriadAnti-Sicilian lines over the board? In high school, your writer was anunimpressive B - average student. In college my grades jumped to a near 4.0 (it would have been 4.0 if it hadn't been for the completely unnecessary,required math and science classes!). The difference? I finally learned thatit's far better to continuously go over my study material very lightly - butall semester long - rather than cram, pulling an all-nighter, before theexam. So just do a study rotation of all your potential Anti-Sicilians, ratherthan just prepare for one line against a specific Anti-Sicilian opponent.} 1.-- {Sometimes when I browse an opening book, written in the 1980s or '90s, itfeels as out of date as watching the 'news' from one of those black and white1930s news reels, which warns of the danger of war brewing in Europe. TheAnti-Sicilians, once mere offshoots, are now close to surpassing the old mainlines of the Open Sicilian and every bit as mainstream. The Antis aren't goingaway, so we must be ready for all of them. --- Some Anti lines may be bothrigorous and exacting to our defensive abilities, yet our position's inherentsoundness is never in doubt. I hope to explain the lines with only a minimalelement of theoretical legalese in the process. In some variations, however,veering from observances of theory can spell immediate disaster for theunknowledgeable, or the experimenter, and theory sometimes hems in ourimagination's freedom.

In the 1960s and '70salmost everyone played their bishop to c4, hoping to generate an attack with0-0, d3, Qe1, f5 and Qh4, with an ominous build-up around Black's king. Today,however, almost everyone knows the defensive mechanisms which render White'splan rather amateurish. Then later, White switches to the most positional Bb5.We respond with ...Nd4, after which we either pick up the bishop pair, gain afuture tempo with ...a6, or chase the bishop to awkward squares like c4 or d3- neither of which is comfortable for the bishop.

Sometimes reason, rationality and logic are askedto give way to imagination - but not without complaint. There is something inhuman nature where the larger the contradiction to reason, the more we seek todefy it. In this chapter the lure of attack extinguishes all other concerns.The Gambits chapter (Smith-Morra and Wing Gambit) differs from all the others,primarily in a level of intensity. If you think about it, isn't it strange togive away a pawn with the white pieces, when theory says a '+=' is our naturalbirthright? I guess they want to bribe their way to the initiative. Of course,a positional player like me lacks the psychological metric for properlyevaluating the alien mind state of the gambiteer, who doesn't strike me as alaw abiding citizen of the chessboard. --- To challenge and take on a singlemember of a cult, is to take them all on. When we accept the Smith-MorraGambit, we do just that, walking into the lair of preparation, with the singleconsoling thought: the gambit may only be borderline sound (I realize thisstatement will earn me the undying hatred of Smith-Morra Gambiteers worldwide).The mad scientist's dream is to build a machine or a creature which thinks,feels and speaks. Of course, the second it's built, it turns evil and tries todestroy its creator.

To declare such a gambit refuted, is to make excessivedemands upon the reader's trust. This is the Wing Gambit (well, when you wereyoung, didn't you sometimes hang out with disreputable friends?). It's time toenter never-never land, where White mixes ideas seen in both the Evans andBenko gambits. Gambiteers - they are essentially martyrs in search of areligion - defend the soundness of their lines, as vigorously as ClarenceDarrow defended Darwin's theories in the Scopes trial. --- One of my misguidedstudents loves the Wing Gambit. I advise him: "Dump it. It doesn't love youback!" Of course, he doesn't believe me, since gambits are dopamine surges forthe attacking addict. I think the Wing Gambit - more than the Smith-Morra - isan opening where the effort and cash outlay aren't commensurate with White'sinvestment's return. For younger players though, I think gambits are fun and agood way to circumvent the theoretical legal process, and just go after theopponent in vigilante-style.} *[Event "?"][Site "?"][Date "????.??.??"][Round "?"][White "Anti-Sicilians are not new"][Black "?"][Result "*"][Annotator "Cyrus Lakdawala"][PlyCount "1"][Source "Everyman Chess"][SourceDate "2016.03.01"]{They have been around, about as long as Open Sicilians, as shown in thefollowing game: O.Strobl-G.Breyer, Vienna 1921.} 1. -- {Today, theAnti-Sicilians rival Open Sicilians as the main line, so let's be prepared forall of them.} (1. -- {Acknowledgements: -- Thanks as always to Editor GM JohnEmms, to IM Richard Palliser for the final edit, and to Nancy,proofreader-in-chief.

I was under the false impression that the b3-Sicilian mustbe a relatively new opening.

White hopes for a theoretically unprepared opponent thatwill grope along for the plan and guess, the way a blind person touches afriend's face, attempting to read and visualize it. --- Our solution is tomeet White's fianchetto with ...Nc6, and ...e5, which effectively builds awall, blunting the b2-bishop's Medusa stare across the board, halting it at e5.Recent games show that Black equalizes quite comfortably with this plan.} ({The second line is a bit more tricky and involves the Kan, Taimanov andScheveningen move order} 2.
