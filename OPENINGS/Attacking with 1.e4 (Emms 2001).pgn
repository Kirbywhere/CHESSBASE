{This is a book aimed for those who want a opening repertoire based on} 1. e4 {
. Moreover, this is an openings book for those who have neither the time nor
the inclination to learn reams and reams of the latest modern opening theory.
When possible, I've deliberately avoided recommending variations which require
massive memorization, or variations where the assessment changes at every
super-grandmaster tournament. No main line Najdorfs, Dragons, Spanish Openings
and Petroffs here! --- In general I've opted for 'opening systems', in which
learning the major ideas is just as important as learning the actual variations.
Even though I've often steered away from main lines, I've made sure that I've
chosen openings with some pedigree. Many of my recommendations have been
played at one time or another by world class players (even World Champions).
--- I have, however, resisted the temptation for an 'all-in-one' solution. For
example, the King's Indian Attack can be played against virtually every
defence to 1 e4, However, it's generally thought that it's at it most
effective when played against the French Defence; it's my choice here, but
only against the French. I've opted for a good variety of systems, ones which
will give you practice in a wide number of positions (it's generally thought
to be good for your chess to familiarize yourself with different types of
openings, rather than sticking to just one).} -- {I've paid particular
attention to the psychological aspect when choosing these opening systems.
I've endeavoured to come up with lines which make Black feel uncomfortable
(I've often drawn on my own experiences for this). I've also avoided virtually
all of Black's gambits, even if they are considered incorrect at the highest
levels. It's just not most players' cup of tea to win an early pawn and then
try and grovel out into an ending. Playing White should be more fun than that!
--- Sometimes, within an opening, I've given White more than one choice of
variation. I've generally done this when there is little to pick between two
or three lines, or when I've decided that a particularly sharp line needs a
good back-up if something new is discovered for Black. Certain lines will
favour certain players: you can make your own choices. --- I've opted for a
'variation by variation' approach; I still believe that this is the best way
of studying a new opening. I've also tried to paint as realistic picture as
possible; I'll certainly say when a particular line is scoring well for White,
but I'll also give the best defences for Black. If Black plays the best moves
he may equalize - that's just chess for you. But even so, I've strove to
ensure that Black has no easy way to reach a dull equality. Even the equal
positions here give White good chances to play for the win! --- I won't go
into the specifics of the repertoire here. This can be discovered as you turn
the pages.} (1... -- {Finally I would like to thank all those who have helped
me in some way or another with this book. Special thanks go to Jonathan Rowson
for some thoughts and recommendations. --- John Emms, Kent, June 2001.}) *

1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 {. The Closed Sicilian is a solid and, at the same time,
aggressive way of meeting 1...c5. It's true that White builds up slowly in the
opening, but the overall aim is an eventual attack on the black king (I admit
that, technically speaking, this could be said about any opening; after all,
the eventual aim is always checkmate!). Seriously though, the Closed Sicilian
is the perfect weapon for players wanting a heavyweight battle, but not having
the time or inclination to study the main lines of the Open Sicilian. Indeed,
even some of the most seasoned professional players are getting fed up of
trying to find the faintest of edges against the Najdorf, Dragon, Scheveningen,
Sveshnikov etc, and are turning their attention elsewhere. --- The Closed
Sicilian has a good pedigree; advocates include former World Champion Boris
Spassky and England's top two, Michael Adams and Nigel Short. Unlike some
anti-Sicilians, there's no easy way for Black to reach dull equality; even if
Black plays the best moves a tense struggle will certainly lie ahead. ---
While researching the Closed Sicilian for this book, it's become apparent to
me how logical White's moves are. It's certainly more important to learn the
ideas than the concrete lines (although both would be ideal!), even though I'm
presenting the variations in a structured way. A final point is that there is
still much uncharted territory and ample opportunity for players to express
new ideas in this opening.} -- (2... -- {Points to Remember: -- 1) The plan of
Be3, Qd2 and then Bh6 is often positionally desirable, especially if Black has
moved his e-pawn. The exchange of the dark-squared bishops leaves the black
king without his most powerful defender and weakens the dark squares on the
kingside (f6 and h6). -- 2) More often than not, Black plays his g8-knight to
the e7-square. If he plays it to f6 instead, then a good long-term plan for
White is a kingside pawn storm, involving h2-h3, g3-g4(-g5) and f4-f5. White
gains time by attacking the knight along the way. -- 3) One of Black' normal
ideas is to occupy the d4-square with a knight, and to gain space on the
queenside with ...b7-b5-b4, chasing the White knight away from c3. White often
reacts to this plan by playing Nd1, before preparing to eject the knight from
d4 with c2-c3. Often this is done in conjunction with removing the king's
knight from either f3 or e2, so as not to allow Black a simplifying exchange
after c2-c3 (see Variation C32, for example). -- 4) Black must be careful not
to play ...Nd4 too early, as this can sometimes be punished (see Variation A).
-- 5) If Black refrains from playing ...Nd4 White is sometimes in a position
to play an advantageous d3-d4.}) *

1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. g3 g6 4. Bg2 Bg7 5. d3 e6 {With this move Black delays
committing the d-pawn with ...d7-d6 and prepares to develop with ...Nge7. This
line often simply transposes to 5...d6 variations, but here we concentrate on
Black refraining from playing an early ...d7-d6, as in some lines Black looks
to gain from this by playing ...d7-d5 instead and thus saving a tempo with
this central counterattack.} 6. Be3 $1 ({It must be said that} 6. f4 {
is also very possible, but in the main I'm recommending playing the Closed
Sicilian with an early Be3 and Qd2. The reasons for this are threefold:
firstly, I believe lines with Be3 and Qd2 to more direct and aggressive than
those with an early f2-f4; secondly, there is less theory for the White player
to learn and lastly, I think lines with Be3 and Qd2 are easier to play. ---
More often than not, White will later offer the exchange of bishops with
Be3-h6, thus weakening Black's control over the dark squares on the kingside.
Indeed this is one of White's key ideas here.}) 6... Nd4 $5 {Black occupies
the all-important d4-square. The knight is actively placed here and it
certainly prevents White from playing d3-d4 in the near future. The knight is
also reasonably secure on d4, being protected by both the bishop on g7 and the
pawn on c5. However, the d4-square isn't an outpost in the strictest sense of
the word - White can fight for its control by moving the c3-knight and playing
c2-c3. --- Other possibilities for Black include:} (6... d6 {transposes to
Variation C4. In fact this move is Black's most popular choice and may well be
Black's best option.}) (6... Qa5 $5 7. Qd2 (7. Nge2 Nd4 8. O-O Ne7 9. Nc1 d6

of Black's most solid options available. Immediately he takes a vice-like grip
on the d4-square and thus rules out for a long time the possibility of d3-d4.
On the other hand, some players might be averse to blocking the long diagonal
and hence restricting the affect of the g7-bishop on the queenside.
Nevertheless, a study of the diagram quickly points to the fact that White's
main pawn break is f2-f4, a move which will allow the g7-bishop back into the
game. In view of this, it's really no surprise that White still often angles
for the exchange of dark-squared bishops with Qd2 and Bh6.} 7. Qd2 (7. f4 {

1. e4 e5 2. Bc4 {. The Bishop's Opening is probably the most straightforward
line to play against 1...e5; White is playing a 'system', and there is
relatively little theory to learn. That said, there's still a bit of theory in
this chapter - you can't get away with knowing nothing! --- The Danish legend
Bent Larsen had quite a bit to do with the popularization of the Bishop's
Opening. Before him it was used very rarely at the highest levels, but Larsen
used it to beat many grandmasters in the 70s and 80s and showed it could be
used as a good weapon. In more recent times players such as Gary Kasparov,
Vishy Anand, Vladimir Kramnik and Michael Adams have used it, especially when
they've fancied having a day off from heavy theoretical battles.} ({One of its
major appeals is that it cuts out many of Black's popular defences in the Open
Games (1 e4 e5). For example,} 2. Nf3 -- ({
, White completely bypasses the super-solid Petroff Defence:} 2... Nf6) ({
, plus all of Black's infinite number of defences against the Ruy Lopez:} 2...
Nc6 3. Bb5 {- no need to learn crazy Schliemann lines:} f5 $5 ({
or to be bored to death by Kramnik's 'Berlin Wall':} 3... Nf6 {.}))) 2... Nf6 {
Black only really has one main defence (other second moves often transpose to
this anyway), so this is a major time-saver on the learning front.} 3. d3 {
The system that I'm advocating is an aggressive one where White plays Bc4,
d2-d3, Nc3 and then, if possible, the pawn-break f2-f4!. This is followed by
Nf3 and (again if possible) 0-0. --- This can be played against various black
set-ups, but White must also be prepared to be flexible; Some black systems
are aimed at countering this plan, and on those occasions it's better for
White to play without f2-f4.} -- (3... -- {Important Points --- Lines with
f2-f4: -- 1) Be aware of the cramping effect on Black's position after a
suitable f4-f5. -- 2) Remember the idea of Na4, attempting to trade off the
knight for Black's dark-squared bishop. This is normally a positionally
desirable exchange and will allow White to castle kingside. -- 3) Remember
also that Black has the same idea of ...Na5, attacking the bishop on c4.
Sometimes it's worth expending a tempo to keep the bishop with a2-a3 or c2-c3.
-- 4) If the idea of Na4 is not suitable, White has different approaches: he
can consider queenside castling, or neutralizing Black's dark-squared bishop
with Qe2 and Be3. -- 5) Watch out for ...Ng4, although usually this move is
not as threatening as it looks!}) (3... -- {More generally: -- 1) f2-f4 is not
usually a good idea if Black can strike out effectively with ...d7-d5 - see
the Main Line, Variation A as an example of this. -- 2) Often Nf3 is a good
answer to ...c7-c6, as now Black cannot defend the e-pawn with Nc6. -- 3) In
the Main Line, Variation A1, White has to decide when it's best to keep the
tension in the centre and when it's best to play exd5. Likewise, Black has to
decide whether to try and keep his centre intact, or to play a simplifying ...dxe4.}) *

Proper', rather than transposing into the Vienna Game with 3 Mc3.} ({Often the

gives Black some extra ones. For example, after 3 Nc3 White has to be
concerned with 3...Bb4 and 3...Nxe4, both of which are perfectly playable
moves. With 3 d3 we avoid these lines; the other side of the coin is that
White has to prepare for 3...d5 (this is not such a problem) and the very

1. e4 e6 2. d3 {introduces the King's Indian Attack (KIA), a very respectable
system, which can actually be played against most defences to 1 e4. For
example, White can play 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 and 3 d3, 1 e4 c6 2 d3 and even 1 e4 e5
2 Nf3 Nc6 3 d3 (the only reasonable defence which avoids the KIA is 1 e4 d5).
--- However, the King's Indian Attack is probably most effective, and
certainly most popular, when it is played against the French Defence. The
point is that Black is already committed to the move ...e7-e6, even though in
a lot of lines he would prefer his e-pawn to be on either e7 or e5! Indeed, in
Main Line 2 we shall be looking at variations where Black loses a tempo early
on to play the desirable ...e6-e5, (1 e4 e6 2 d3 Nc6 3 Nf3 e5!? being one
extreme example). --- The King's Indian Attack has been utilized by many world
class players. One could list World Champions Mikhail Botvinnik, Vassily
Smyslov and Tigran Petrosian, while Bobby Fischer turned to it when he was
having trouble proving any advantage in the main lines of the French. More
recent advocates include such attacking geniuses as Alexei Shirov and
Alexander Morozevich. --- White's idea is pretty straightforward and easy to
play. To a certain extent White plays the same moves regardless of how Black
plays. The set-up involves developing moves such as Nd2, Ngf3, g2-g3, Bg2, 0-0
and Re1.} d5 3. Nd2 c5 4. Ngf3 Nc6 5. g3 Nf6 6. Bg2 Be7 7. O-O O-O 8. Re1 {
is a typical position, White having just played the move Re1. A characteristic
plan of action would begin with the move e4-e5. This 'pawn wedge' on e5 acts
as a catalyst for a kingside attack, as it gives White plenty of space to
manoeuvre on the kingside, and it deprives Black the use of the f6-square, the
normal position for a defensive knight. White can follow up e4-e5 with such
moves as h2-h4, Nf1, Bf4, N1h2-g4 and perhaps h4-h5-h6. It's easy to see how a
potentially lethal attack can arise, especially if Black is not careful.
Naturally White will alter his general plan according to which set-up Black
chooses, but this plan of a kingside attack crops up many times. --- I can't
promise a theoretical advantage in all lines of the KIA, but even when Black
chooses the best defences, positions arise which are lively and knife-edged;
this is why the KIA is a favourite weapon for the attacking player.} -- (8...
-- {Important Points: --- Main Line 1: -- 1) Think carefully before advancing
with e4-e5; this lunge is usually more effective once Black has committed
himself to castling kingside, or when White can easily support the advanced
pawn. -- 2) If you play e4-e5, be wary of undermining attempts from Black,
including the advance ...g7(g6)-g5. -- 3) Be aware of exd5 ideas, which can be
advantageous to White in some lines, especially if Black is lagging behind in
development. This motif is especially important in Variation B. -- 4) If White
has played e4-e5 and Black pressures the pawn with ...Qc7, White should look
out for tricks involving Bf4 and then capturing on d5 with a piece (see
Variation A22). -- 5) In Variation A242, White often plays the move a2-a3, to
prevent Black playing ...a4-a3. This idea was first adopted by Bobby Fischer.
-- 6) Bear in mind ideas of h4 for White. In Variation B Black often meets
this with ...h7-h6, preparing to meet h4-h5 with ...g6-g5. Similarly, White
often meets and unprovoked ...h7-h6 with ...h2-h4, making Black think twice
about playing ...g6-g5.}) (8... -- {Main Line 2: -- 1) If Black exchanges too
early on e4, White can consider deploying his light-squared bishop on the
f1-a6 diagonal. -- 2) If Black plays an early ...b7-b6, White often plays
e4-e5, following up with d3-d4.}) *

extra options; he can try to force Black into transpositions that may not be
comfortable for the second player (this will become apparent when we study the
theory and the numerous transpositions). It's true that Black also has extra
options after 2 c4, but the White player has no need to fear these. In any
case, the majority of Caro-Kann players will be attempting to steer the game
back into a normal path with 2...d5, and it's here where White can adopt some
devious move orders!}) 2... -- {

lure your opponent into unfamiliar territory. -- 2) There are many attacking
possibilities discussed in this chapter for White in IQP and 'hanging pawns'
positions. Familiarize yourself with these.}) (2... -- {Variation B: -- 1)
Don't feel too concerned about having to face a 'King's Indian' set-up. It's
only one line, which is meant to be quite favourable to White. Anyway, it's
very possible that your opponent will feel less comfortable than you! -- 2)
The manoeuvre Nf3-e1-d3 is seen quite often once the position is closed with
d4-d5 and ...c6-c5. From c3 the knight support both the f2-f4 and b2-b4 breaks.

1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 {. The Pirc Defence appeals to the Black player
who likes to fianchetto his dark-squared bishop. This gives Black security on
the kingside, where the bishop is used as a solid defender to the castled king.
The Pirc is similar to the more popular King's Indian (1 d4 Nf6 2 c4 g6) in
another way; Black allows White to occupy the centre with pawns and generally
only strikes back in the centre once his forces are co-ordinated. The Pirc is
well suited to players who like to counter-attack, and its famous adherents
include former Russian Champion Peter Svidler and Slovenian number one
Alexander Beliavsky. --- The way to attack the Pirc Defence that I'm
advocating is with a very simple, but frighteningly effective system. White
plays an early} 4. Be3 {and Qd2, lining up the two pieces along the c1-h6
diagonal. Then White often plays Bh6, in order to exchange the dark-squared
bishops. This is sometimes augmented by shoving the h-pawn down the board to
attack Black's castled king. Then, in Fischer's words, 'pry open the h-file,
sac, sac... mate!' --- In recent years White's system has been dubbed 'the 150
Attack', a reference to the idea that this way of attack would be the first
thing a club player would think of (a British grade of 150 is roughly
equivalent to an Elo rating of 1800). I can still remember a comment from my
Pirc playing days when, after having been checkmated by Qg7, I was told that
this was exactly what I should have expected, after having weakened myself
with ...g7-g6 as early as move three! Experience of playing both sides of the
Pirc has taught me that many Black players feel uncomfortable playing against
the 150 Attack, and more generally, when their 'Pirc bishop' is exchanged. The
150 Attack is an excellent weapon at club level, but it's also very popular at
the highest levels: Gary Kasparov, Vishy Anand, Michael Adams and Nigel Short
have all used it to good effect.} -- {Before we move onto the theory, I should
also point out that, to be comprehensive, as well as 3...g6 (the Pirc), we
shall also be looking at less popular third move choices for Black, including
3...e5 and 3...c6.} (4... -- {Important Points: -- 1) If you see a promising
kingside attacking idea, go for it! The 150 Attack is specifically geared for
this. -- 2) Useful attacking ideas include: exchanging bishops with Bh6,
forcing the defensive knight to move with e4-e5, and opening the h-file with
h2-h4-h5. -- 3) Black will often try to exchange his light-squared bishop for
your knight on f3, with ...Bg4xf3. Be aware of opportunities when this can and
should be avoided. -- 4) If Black lunges too quickly on the queenside with ...b7-b5, sometimes it's better for White to adopt a different plan involving
striking back with a2-a4. -- 5) Black sometimes keeps delays developing his
bishop to g7, preferring to keep it on f8. Be aware that the exchange of
bishops with Bh6 now effectively loses a tempo.}) *

1. e4 g6 2. d4 Bg7 3. Nc3 d6 4. Be3 {. The Modern Defence is very closely
related to the Pirc Defence. Indeed, one often transposes into the other.
There are subtle differences, however. From Black's point of view, one of the
advantages of the Modern Defence move order is that he has not committed his
knight to f6 so early. This piece can be kept on g8, so that the g7-bishop is
not blocked, and so that White is not able to exchange bishops quickly with
Bh6. Black can begin queenside operations early on, only finishing development
on the kingside when it suits him. --- So why doesn't everyone play the Modern
move order rather than the Pirc? Well, there's some good news for White as
well. With the knight on g8, Black is still two moves from castling, and this
can be hazardous if the position suddenly opens up. Another factor is that
White can consider a very early pawn lunge with h2-h4-h5, making use of
Black's lack of control over h5. One final factor is that White doesn't have
to worry so much about the possibility of ...Ng4. Of course there are other
reasons outside the 150 Attack as to why Black chooses the Pirc over the
Modern, or vice-versa (playing the Modern move-order allows 3 c4, for instance)
. --- As well as the main move (3...d6), we shall also be having a quick look
at third move alternatives for Black.} -- (4... -- {Important Points: -- 1)
Look out for opportunities to exploit the fact that Black has delayed ...Nf6.
-- 2) When Black answers h2-h4 with ...h7-h5, the g5 square becomes a useful
outpost for a white knight after Nh3-g5. -- 3) If Black lunges too quickly on
the queenside with ...b7-b5, sometimes it's better for White to adopt a
different plan involving striking back with a2-a4. -- 4) Look out for
attacking ideas against Black's king, which often remains uncastled for a long
time.}) *

1. e4 d5 2. exd5 {. The Scandinavian Defence has been one of the fastest
growing openings of recent years. Before then it was considered to be very
much a 'second string' opening, and at grandmaster level it was only played by
a few die-hards, including the Danish GM Bent Larsen and, after him, the
Australian Ian Rogers. However, in the nineties a whole new generation of GMs
started to appreciate that Black's chances in many of the main lines had been
grossly underestimated. Suddenly the defence became very popular, and much new
theory was created. At first, most of the new theory consisted of new ideas
and improvements on old ones from Black's point of view, but more recently
there have been fresh and important ideas for White as well. Unsurprisingly,
perhaps, the Scandinavian has probably passed its peak of popularity, but it
remains a far more respected defence than it did a couple of decades ago.} -- {

Nf6 and 2...Qxd5.} ({Against} 2... Nf6 {I was close to advocating 3 c4 c6 4
Nc3 cxd5 5 cxd5, transposing into the Caro-Kann chapter. However, I decided
that after 3...e6!? 4 dxe6 Bxe6 (The Icelandic Gambit), Black has far too much
fun, especially at anything under grandmaster level. Instead I've opted for
the tricky} 3. Bb5+ {
(it's tricky in that it avoids some of Black's unusual lines against 3 d4).}) (
{Against} 2... Qxd5 {I've been a bit more mainstream in my recommendations,
although what I suggest against the popular} 3. Nc3 Qa5 {
is quite rare, so there is still quite a bit uncharted territory here.}) (2...
-- {Important Points: -- 1) With 3 Bb5+ against 2...Nf6, White dictates the
type of position that is reached. Black has less choice than against the main
line with 3 d4. -- 2) In Variation A White generally looks to play an early
c2-c4 to get rid of the black knight on d5. -- 3) In the main line (B3) White
plays an early Ne4xf6+ and inflicts doubled pawn on Black.}) *

1. e4 Nf6 2. e5 {. The Alekhine is a counter-attacking defence in the same
vein as the Modern or Pirc. With his first move Black actually invites White
to gain time by attacking his knight with pawns. The result is that White has
an impressive-looking centre after just a few moves. Black hopes that this
centre will prove to be suspect to a quick attack. --- For White I'm
recommending the Exchange Variation,} Nd5 3. c4 Nb6 4. d4 d6 5. exd6 {
, which is much easier to play than main line of 3 d4 (there's much less
theory to learn), and, in my opinion, it gives White just as much chance of
claiming an advantage from the opening.} -- (5... -- {Important Points: -- 1)
White's set-up in Variation B is very ambitious. White prevents Black from
playing ...d7-d5 and encourages only ...e7-e5. -- 2) After ...Nc6 (Variation B)

is slightly worse. -- 3) Be wary that you are making lot of moves on the
queenside in Variation B. At some point you have to stop and think of
developing your kingside!}) *

1. e4 {Finally, we should take a look at some unusual moves that Black can
play on move one. There are twenty legal moves at Black's disposal; as well as
the ones we've already studied, I will draw the line with the following three:}
-- ({A:} 1... Nc6) ({B:} 1... b6) ({C:} 1... a6) (1... -- {Against anything
else my advice is: -- 1) Try not to laugh (this is discourteous to your
opponent). -- 2) Don't think for hours trying to find a quick refutation; just
play normal sensible moves and enjoy the game!}) (1... -- {Important Points:
-- 1) The continued utilization of these openings by certain Grandmasters
suggests that they are not so bad. Don't look for a direct refutation; just
play normal developing moves. -- 2) If you study the suggested lines here,
your opponent's unusual choices will lose much of their surprise value.}) *
