{The King's Indian and the Grünfeld are two of Black's most popular answers to
} 1. d4 {; unsurprising given that they were long-time favourites of chess
legends Garry Kasparov and, before him, Bobby Fischer. Brimming with
complexity and dynamism, these two openings often leave those playing White
scratching their heads wondering how to squeeze even the slightest of
advantages out of the opening and, just as crucially, how to avoid becoming
swamped in a morass of complicated theory. --- It's time for White to strike
back! In this book, Timothy Taylor gets to grips with the King's Indian and
Grünfeld, providing White with a number of easy-to-learn and effective weapons
which are specially designed to cause Black maximum discomfort. Taylor examines
the typical tactical and positional ideas for both players, highlighting the
tricks and pitfalls one must look out for. A study of this book will allow the
reader to battle against the King's Indian and the Grünfeld with renewed
confidence.} (1. -- {International Master Timothy Taylor is an experienced
tournament player who has enjoyed several notable successes, including winning
the US Open. He is also a skilled chess writer, one of his previous books, How
to Defeat the Smith-Morra Gambit, becoming a US Chess Federation bestseller.})

{This book is for those who want to beat the King's Indian and Grünfeld
Defences without studying for years. My goal is to offer sound but unexplored
lines. --- Take the King's Indian first - what sort of players are our foes?
--- King's Indian players love to build up prolonged attacks behind their wall
of pawns. For example, no matter what new lines White throws at them in the
Mar del Plata variation, the Black players are happy: White might win the
queenside, but if the sable forces break through, the white king dies.} 1. d4
Nf6 2. c4 g6 {. I have no interest in this extremely fashionable line, for two
reasons. One, I have no desire to see my king get attacked - I'd rather do the
attacking! Two, the amount of theory in the Mar del Plata has long passed the
"well analyzed" point and has now become "completely absurd"! Only a computer
or a twenty year old raised with a computer wired into his brain can deal with
the near infinite number of "book" variations. --- Let's take a random example.
Here is the great Garry Kasparov defeating a world class player, Boris Gelfand,
on the black side of the infamous variation (see the following game).} *

how many games it carried with that line. Answer: 15,783 games! Ridiculous!

for an absurdly long time. I checked on move 20, and even then two other games
in the database were still following the exact same path! And some
subvariations are even worse! --- I ask you, do you want to lose a game
because your opponent has a better memory or a better computer? He remembered
Gelfand-Kasparov, Paris 1991, and you didn't! Shame! Or ...blah! We have here
the chess equivalent of the "theatre of the absurd"!} 0-1

{In this book I'm offering two main variations of the Four Pawns Attack as the
best practical way for the creative, attacking player to defeat the King's
Indian. --- My number one, "win at all costs" line is what I will call the
Martz Variation, after the American IM who played it with great success
throughout his career. In this line White plays for a Maróczy Bind set-up that
gives him space and attacking chances. Even more important, Black will be too
busy defending to think of attacking you! --- Let's see what the Big Database
has to say about this line. Taking one of the games that will be featured in

After eight moves, which establishes the Martz Variation, the Big Database
finds only 270 games - now this is a lot more manageable than 15,783! And by
move 20, the game has entered completely uncharted realms (I offer an original
pawn sacrifice at this point) and there is no such thing as "theory", no other
games in the database, just two competitors playing chess, not showing off
their memory or computer programs! --- Now let's step back into the past,
before the infernal machine was invented, and revisit some great games from
perhaps the most famous international tournament of all time, New York 1924.
--- Alexander Alekhine, three years away from dethroning Capablanca and
becoming the fourth World Champion, fearlessly ventured the Four Pawns Attack
in three crucial games against very strong opposition: Frank Marshall, F.D.Yates, and Edward Lasker. He scored 2-1, a win against Yates and two draws,
which is a good percentage score, but there is a lot more to learn from these
games than result percentages. --- If we look more deeply at these games, we
see that, based on how he came out of the opening, Alekhine should have scored
3-0! There is no doubt that the future World Champion had a decisive advantage
by move 20 in all three games, as the following analysis will show. --- So
that's quite good for our opening, yes?} (59. -- {But let's look a little
further still. In the two drawn games, I will demonstrate that Alekhine went
from having a crushing position out of the opening to dead lost endings! Yes,
both Marshall and Edward Lasker missed absolutely forced wins! The half points
were saved only by Alekhine's gutsy defence, his incredible belief in his own
position, and yes, his opponents' blunders. --- Now what should we think of
the opening? The result could just as easily have been 1-2 (!), surely not so
good for White. --- The answer is simply this: the Four Pawns Attack is a
risky opening. By advancing all four of his most central pawns, White burns
his own bridges by move five! Pawns can't move backward! The direct assault
from the pawn phalanx means that White can blow his opponent away in twenty
moves; yet this same assault leaves weaknesses in the White position, which
means that the slightest mistake (as even such a great player as Alekhine
might make) can completely reverse the evaluation of the position. --- This is
the point where you, the prospective reader, should now either run to the cash
register or run away in terror!}) (59. -- {I promise you a very sharp, still
quite unexplored line, by which you may "Beat the King's Indian". However, I
do not promise you a free ride - by "signing on" to the Four Pawns Attack, you
are taking a chance, committing your whole army even before development. ---
You're taking a risk. --- If you play it right, you will be amazed at how many
quick victories you score. --- But you might also suffer a painful endgame
loss or two - or then again, you might be like Alekhine, and even when your
attack fails, you'll still save the ending! --- The most important thing is
that White attacks fiercely by move six. A few more moves and Black can be
overwhelmed. --- Or he had better be overwhelmed, but just remember, fortune
favours the brave! --- Alekhine got ready to be World Champion by risking all
in the highest profile encounters. --- (Just a thought here, can you imagine
Kramnik playing the Four Pawns Attack at Linares??) --- Now let's see Alekhine
take his chances (see the following game).}) 1-0

What are we to make of this game between two all time greats, both ranked at
the time in the top five in the world? --- They both missed forced wins. Both

opening: the position became so sharp so early that it demanded enormous
effort from both players - this 'extreme chess' led to the blunders later. ---
For the reader who is taking up the Four Pawns Attack for the first time, I
must stress one thing above all: to find Ariadne in this Minotaur's labyrinth
you must literally feel your way. Sometimes the positions simply become
incalculable - or to put it differently, you might be able to calculate your
way through one move, only to find yourself in desperate time pressure
thereafter!}) (62. -- {The best way to learn this opening, once you have
finished this book, is simply to play it! Your opponents will probably have no
more experience than you will, and they will be defending! So press on, win a
few games, lose a few, but get that magical feel for the attack which is so
necessary here. --- Give some thought to Alekhine's two big blunders: he
missed the winning 18 Qc2 (aiming at the black king) because he "centralized"
his queen; then he missed the winning, kingside-destroying 28 Nfxg5 because he
took an irrelevant queenside pawn with 28 Bxc7. --- This is an opening where
one must, nearly always, look first at the attacking moves - specifically the
attack the king moves! Once you develop that extra sense of attack, that
constant eye flicker toward the king, you will really start to rack up points!}

{Now let's see how Alekhine does everything right. This time the game, against
F.D.Yates, is "strategically decided" by move eleven, and Alekhine makes no
mistake afterward. As Hermann Helms dryly comments in the round introduction:
"The game was not greatly prolonged."} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 d6 3. Nc3 g6 4. e4 Bg7
5. f4 O-O 6. Nf3 Nc6 7. Be2 {The position has a superficial similarity to the
previous game, but there the b8-knight moved only after 6...Bg4 7 Be2,} ({and
this slight change means that} 7. d5 {is not so effective here: Black can
answer} Nb4 8. Be2 c6 9. O-O Qb6+ 10. Kh1 Ng4 {with counterplay.}) 7... Nd7 {
Likewise the position changes from Black's point of view too - in the
analogous Marshall game the second player had the threat to conquer d4,} ({but
here the same manoeuvre fails tactically:} 7... e5 8. fxe5 dxe5 9. d5 Nd4 10.
Nxd4 exd4 11. Qxd4 {and now} Nxe4 $4 {fails as the e-file is not open,} ({but
if instead} 11... Ng4 12. Qd3 Qh4+ 13. Qg3 {and Black has no real compensation
for the pawn.})) 8. Be3 e5 {Black accomplishes this central counter, but what
did he really get out of it? The knight on d7 is misplaced, blocking the
c8-bishop, while the knight on c6 will soon be hit as White gains space with
tempo.} 9. fxe5 dxe5 10. d5 Ncb8 11. c5 {Alekhine bluntly states that White's
position is already "won from a strategical point of view." The computer
agrees, giving White a plus of over 1 point, so it's as if White were already
a clear pawn up. --- Why these overwhelmingly one-sided evaluations? Just look
at the position! --- White has, first and foremost, a huge advantage in the
centre, in that the mobile d- and c-pawns (both already on the fifth rank!)
dominate that sector of the board. Meanwhile Black has no, I mean zero
queenside development. --- White's half-open f-file is clearly more useful
than Black's half-open d-file: the former can easily be part of an attack
involving such natural moves as 0-0, Bc4, and d5-d6, while one sees no
prospects for Black on the d-file, seeing as he only controls two squares of
it! --- So Alekhine's evaluation is correct: White has a won game... but wait!
It's only move eleven! Black is a strong player, the equivalent today of a
solid mid-range GM. How can he be busted so fast? --- The answer lies, once
again, in the sharpness of this opening. Black was too slow finding
counterplay - his two knight manoeuvre just lost time and space - and White's
pawns were even so early ready to roll forward. --- This is the kind of crush
that makes this opening so much fun to play!} a5 12. O-O Na6 13. Na4 Qe7 14.
Rc1 h6 {One can't call this move a blunder: Black's position is so horrible
that anything would lose.} ({For example, had Black avoided the skewer seen in
the game with} 14... Re8 {, White would have set up the crushing f-file attack
mentioned in the note above with} 15. d6 cxd6 16. cxd6 Qd8 17. Bc4 {and
White's pressure is decisive.}) 15. Bxa6 {Alekhine alertly picks up the
exchange with this tactic,} ({but} 15. d6 cxd6 16. cxd6 Qd8 17. Bc4 {as above
is also good, with a huge positional advantage.}) 15... Rxa6 16. c6 bxc6 17.
dxc6 Nb8 18. Bc5 Qe8 19. Bxf8 Bxf8 20. Nc3 Rxc6 21. Nd5 {White is winning. The
knight on d5 dominates the board, while Black has only a dubious and soon lost
queenside pawn for the exchange. Alekhine handles the technical part
efficiently.} Rd6 22. Rxc7 Na6 23. Rc3 Nb4 24. Nxe5 $1 {Tactical alertness
once again! Black might have saved himself some trouble and resigned now - the
rest needs no comment.} Ba6 25. Nc4 Bxc4 26. Rxc4 Qe5 27. Qf3 f5 28. Nxb4 axb4
29. exf5 Rf6 30. Qe4 Bc5+ 31. Kh1 Rxf5 32. Rxf5 {. The moral of this game is
clear: the unprepared Black player can be busted by move eleven in the Four
Pawns Attack!} 1-0

text move gives him a solid advantage - but not in Alekhine's mind! In his
analysis Alekhine excoriates this perfectly natural, strong move; in fact he
devotes three successive notes to lamenting his "haste", refers to the
"psychological effect of the omission on the 18th move" and in general kicks
himself down the block!} ({He recommends} 18. Rb1 {which is indeed very strong:
the b-pawn is immune due to the potential pin on the a3-f8 diagonal, and so
White can keep the queens on and launch a powerful board-wide attack, e.g.}

The actual move played, 18 c5, is not quite so crushing, but it does mobilize
the queenside pawns with tempo, keeping a solid plus. --- The only real
disadvantage of 18 c5, as compared with 18 Rb1, is that Black can now force
the exchange of queens, and this is what made Alekhine flip out. (He was so
obviously distraught that even in his annotations he was unable to see that
objectively White is still much better.)}) 18... Qf6 19. Qxf6 $2 ({All White

with his powerful and mobile queenside pawns. There is little doubt Alekhine
would have defeated Edward Lasker had he kept his head and played solidly
here! --- A sample continuation would be 19 Rb1} Qxh4 20. Nxh4 fxe4 21. Rxf8+

tactic.} 39. Ra7 Nd4+ $4 ({The simple} 39... Bc5 $1 40. Ra4 (40. Rxa2 Rf2+ {

pluses and minuses of the Four Pawns Attack than these three games. --- The
power of the opening can be seen by the fact that Alekhine reached a winning
position by move 20 in all three games (and he was winning by move eleven
against Yates!). --- The risk factor can be seen with equal clarity. By
throwing all his centre pawns forward in the opening, White leaves himself no
way to retreat, making any mistake twice as dangerous. --- The opening
literally requires White to be ruthlessly accurate, or his dominant centre and
middlegame attack could meltdown into a lost ending! --- Amusingly enough, two
World Champions who were renowned for their solid play - Capablanca and
Petrosian - both ventured the Four Pawns Attack (Game 4 for Capa, Game 21 for
Petrosian) and in each case the champion won decisively in 24 moves! Did this
encourage Jose and Tigran to play this opening on a regular basis? No!
Undoubtedly shocked by the level of risk they had assumed, despite their quick
successes, neither champion ever dared play this wild attack again! --- But if
you are ready to take some chances, turn the page!} 1/2-1/2

{How to beat the King's Indian?} 1. -- {I am offering two recipes.} ({First,
the Martz Variation, which I consider objectively strongest. The moves to
reach the basic tabiya are:} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. -- (5.
Be2 O-O 6. f4 c5 7. Nf3 cxd4 8. Nxd4 Nc6 9. Be3 {.}) ({. The second, the Liz
Variation, is reached after} 5. f4 O-O 6. Nf3 c5 7. d5 e6 8. Be2 exd5 9. exd5 {
. This is slightly quieter and safer than the Martz, but also gives good
winning chances. This will be covered in Chapters 3 and 4, and I will discuss
the ideas of this variation in the introduction to Chapter 3.}) ({. You will
notice I completely reject the transposition to the Benoni that could occur in
either line after} 5. Be2 O-O 6. f4 c5 7. d5 e6 8. Nf3 exd5 9. cxd5 {. There
are two reasons for this: One, I simply cannot stand these booked-up
variations. How many games does the above line have in the Big Database? 2822!
The very number makes my head hurt, and what hurts more is that some twelve
year old I might play probably has every game memorized! --- My second reason
is a pure chess analysis one: I think that Black can objectively equalize in
that Benoni line with the best counter,} Bg4 {, when White scores less than
50% and I can't find any particular improvement - and if I really wanted to
look for one, I'd have to find it out around move 25, which is far too absurd
for me! I prefer a less booked-up line that offers good winning chances! --- I
call the Martz Variation, the subject of Chapters 1 and 2 of this book, after
the American IM William Martz who played it with success throughout his career.
I witnessed one of his upsets: at Lone Pine in the 70s, Martz had White
against Petrosian. He whipped out his variation, and Petrosian immediately
smelled a very large rat - and offered a draw on, as I recall, either move 10
or 11! Martz politely accepted the ex-World Champion's offer. Given the big
rating difference between them a draw was a success for Martz, but I wonder if
perhaps later he regretted not playing on?} (9... --))) ({What sort of
position scared Petrosian so much that he had to offer an IM a draw in the
opening? To repeat the opening moves, the basic tabiya is reached after:} 1. d4
Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Be2 O-O 6. f4 c5 7. Nf3 cxd4 8. Nxd4 Nc6 9.
Be3 {White has a sort of super Maróczy Bind, with the regular bind (pawns at
c4 and e4, knight at d4) accentuated by the pawn at f4, which adds attacking
chances to the normal Maróczy squeeze. --- It's important to note that many
other openings that can reach Maróczy positions can transpose to the above
variation. Consider if we add a move for each colour to the above variation:}
Bd7 10. O-O {.}) ({We then reach a position from Game 4, which started out as
a Sicilian Accelerated Dragon:} 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 g6 5.
Be3 Bg7 6. c4 d6 7. Nc3 Nf6 8. Be2 Bd7 9. O-O O-O 10. f4 {.}) ({Game 5 uses an
English or Réti move order:} 1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 c5 5. d4 cxd4
6. Nxd4 d6 7. Be2 O-O 8. O-O Nc6 9. Be3 {and we're back to the Martz! It's
good to know these tricky transpositions, which are also good for confusing
your opponent! --- But back to the main ideas: As I said above, the Martz
combines positional squeeze with attacking potential. The most popular defence
is} Bd7 {seen in Games 4, 5 and 6. Black simply develops and dares White to do
his worst - unfortunately for Black, that "worst" often turns out to be a
fatal attack on the black king! See Game 6 for a relentless example of direct
assault!} ({An opposite defensive strategy is seen in Games 7-10. There Black
tries to immediately exchange pieces with bishop or knight to g4. The} 9... Bg4
{line forces off a large number of pieces, including the queens, though the
ending is still difficult for Black.}) ({Fischer liked the} 9... Ng4 {line,
but improvements for White have been found. --- Less popular defences - which
are often more dangerous for Black - are dealt with in Games 11-15. One should
note that even small inaccuracies by Black can be severely punished, as in
Game 11, Taylor-Hermansen.})) *

note on move order. As I mentioned in the introduction, the Four Pawns Attack
of the King's Indian can arise from the Accelerated Dragon, and also from
English/Réti systems. --- But what if we actually start off with the d-pawn?

like a "theoretically bad bishop" and demonstrate that a space advantage and
attacking chances are more important.} 1-0

virtually by force to an ending favourable to White, reached after the moves}
10. Nxc6 Bxe2 11. Nxd8 Bxd1 12. Rxd1 Rfxd8 13. Ke2 {. (There is only one
serious alternative in this sequence, 12 Nxf7, but while this may give White a
small edge with exact play, it's hardly worth the complications when the main
line favours White so much - see Taylor-Peters given in the notes.) But back
to the ending reached after 13 Ke2: White has more space, a better king, and
generally more active pieces. The Maróczy Bind still limits Black's play. ---
Four Pawns Attack specialists like Martz and Uhlmann never lose this. Martz
scored three wins and one draw from the position after 13 Ke2, while Uhlmann
scored one win and two draws (and he could have made it 2-1 had he just worked
a tiny bit harder against Gligoric - see the note to Black's 14th move). ---
There are 21 games in the Big Database with this position: 7 wins for White,
12 draws, and only 2 Black wins. I don't play the King's Indian myself, but if
I did, I would never play this line. Black has virtually no chance to win, but
must suffer an inferior ending, and hope (or perhaps pray!) to draw.}) 10. Nxc6

far O.Neikirkh-B.Pietrusiak, Polanica Zdroj 1965), which is supposed to be
"slight advantage to White" according to 'ECO'. However, I completely disagree
with that evaluation: the weakness of the light squares created by the
exchange of the king's bishop means Black has excellent counterplay against c4
and e4. Black can play} Qc8 {with the idea ...Qe6, and White is pushed onto
the defensive - I'd say somewhat better for Black rather than somewhat better
for White!}) 10... Bxe2 11. Nxd8 ({Ineffective is} 11. Qxe2 bxc6 {as Black
brings a pawn to the centre, neutralizing White's bind, while the b-file is
opened for Black's counterplay.}) 11... Bxd1 12. Rxd1 {Again best; Black will
find it difficult to draw. Both of the pawn grabs with the knight are worse,
as they lose time.} ({The weaker of the two tries is} 12. Nxb7 {as Black has
more than enough counterplay after} Bc2 {.}) ({More interesting is} 12. Nxf7 {

due to White's weak pawns. --- Even though I could have obtained a small edge
with this line, it cannot be recommended and I don't plan on playing it again;
the main line gives White a larger advantage, while Black has far less play.})
12... Rfxd8 13. Ke2 {The point I am making with the last few notes is that
there is really no good way for either side to deviate after 9...Bg4; one
arrives at the present position more or less by force. The attacking player
who likes the Four Pawns Attack must realize that Black can virtually force
this endgame position - but one should not be too unhappy! The ending
definitely favours White, who has scored 62% from this position in the Big
Database.} Rdc8 ({For} 13... Ng4 {see Martz-Goodman, Game 8; this simplifying

leads to an easily winning endgame (see variation below). Anyway, I kept
looking - and fortunately for me, there are in fact two forced wins in the

0-0, I again must note the statistics, courtesy of the Big Database. Of six
games with this position, White wins three and Black makes three draws. In
general I am not much of a believer in chess statistics (too many games by
weak players skew the results, or a single innovation can turn around a
seemingly "favourable" variation - but on the other hand I am surprised at the
overwhelming results of the Four Pawns Attack in practice. Why is this opening
not played more? If one should look me up in the Big Database, filter to find
only games where I am White in the E76-E79 range (the true Four Pawns Attack),
then one sees 3 wins and 1 loss. Even disregarding that I was winning in the
one lost game, that's a 75% score! This position after 12 0-0 - dubiously
given an equal (!) assessment in 'ECO' - also has a 75% score! Why then are
people trying to memorize the Mar del Plata variation 20 or 30 moves deep? In
the late 50s and early 60s, top players like Tal and Benko played the Four
Pawns Attack. It's just as strong an opening now as it was then, but there's
that one tiny little difference: now it's out of fashion. But as the late rock
critic Lester Bangs said, "Fashion is fascism!"} ({Benko comments in the

{Black has a tough road in the Martz Variation. I simply can't find a way for
Black to equalize in the main lines. Furthermore, it is very very difficult
for Black to play for a win. Meanwhile, White enjoys attacking chances and
very often positional pressure such as the ubiquitous d6 weakness that Black
must so often suffer. --- The popular 9...Bd7 leads to Accelerated Dragon type
positions where White, because of the double advance of the f-pawn, has
attacking chances to go with a positional squeeze. Improvements are of course
possible in this complex line, but right now the chances are all on White's
side. --- I think Black's best chance in the mainline Martz is the simplifying
9...Bg4 line, especially as seen in Game 8, Martz-Goodman. Black has to defend
extremely accurately, but he may be able to make a draw here. --- The other
lines, as played by Stein and Gligoric, are hopeless nowadays in the one
session era. Perhaps GMs could save those positions back in the day (with the
help of adjournments, seconds and 16 moves an hour), but no one is going to
hold positions with a static weakness at d6 in a sudden death finale! ---
Fischer's 9...Ng4 was killed by Pomar and hasn't come back to life. The ...e5
defences need a lot of White or Tal help to equalize. And the rare defences
seen in Game 15 will probably stay that way.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4.

This third knight move has always been favoured by GM Bisguier and there is

think the dark side of the move is more important. There are two main breaks
by which Black can destroy the Maróczy Bind: ...b5 and ...f5. While the white
knight is centralized on d4, it monitors both of these uprisings. Once it goes

here, if White just takes on e5, Black may be able to get the pawn back, but

exactly once, against Lautier, and I think it was just a straight up bluff. In
the game Lautier feared the bluff and played the weak 9 d5, which allows the
knight on rim to enter the game with effect. --- The funny thing that happens
when a bluff like this works is that - because it's Kasparov - the line
becomes "theory" and few dare to make the obvious move: just chop the damn
pawn off. In fact, people will willingly play a bad move just to "follow their
leaders" like soldiers shipping out to Iraq.} 9. Nxe5 $1 {Best! White scores a

variations show. --- 11 Qb3 is best: White must challenge the strong black
queen, and queen exchanges generally speaking favour White in this pawn
structure, as White gets open lines on the queenside. Meanwhile, the great
strength of Black's kingside attacks in the King's Indian is that they are
attacks on the king, but without queens that is not a problem, and White's

b8-knight's best development and gives White a strong protected passed pawn,
is that it is not quite as bad as it looks. A few GMs have experimented with
it, but 8...c5 is rarely played now as the correct antidote, 9 Bg5, has been
found. Basically, Black's idea is to play ...Ne8-d6 and then, with the
blockader in place, counterattack with ...f5. This works like a charm in
Jezek-Uhlmann given in the next note, but runs into great difficulties if
White pins the key knight. If Black can't get his knight to d6, the white
protected passed pawn is too strong - but after Bg5, the knight manoeuvre can
only be accomplished by weakening the kingside with pawn advances, or by
misplacing the queen to free the pin. Neither variation gives Black equality;
but White must not overestimate since careless play, as will be seen here, can
even lose the most favourable positions!} ({The better} 8... c6 {was played in

{This chapter is the graveyard of variations! Bisguier's 9 Nc2 has been killed
by Mezentsev's accurate knight manoeuvre. Kasparov's 6...Na6 and 7...e5
crashes and burns when White just takes with 9 Nxe5. Little King's Indian
moves like 5...c6 or 5...Nbd7 get slaughtered by the onrushing pawns. About
the only line that holds up is that seen in Taylor-Wohl (Game 19), where (in
that specific move order) 6...e5 turns out to be playable and White must work
hard for a slight advantage. Note again that White can avoid that line by
playing the move order 5 f4 0-0 6 Nf3; but if White goes that way, Black can
avoid the extremely dangerous Martz Variation by throwing in 5...c5, when
White's best is 6 d5, which will reach the Liz Variation - the subject of our
next chapter!} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Be2 O-O (5... c6 {-

{The Liz Variation starts with the moves:} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4
d6 5. f4 O-O 6. Nf3 c5 7. d5 e6 8. Be2 exd5 9. exd5 {White disobeys the rule
"capture toward the centre" and so avoids a googol of Benoni variations. The
move has its positional logic: the obstructing e-pawn is removed from the
b1-h7 diagonal, so White's light-squared bishop will often find useful
employment later at d3. Also, while White has the same space advantage as in
the Benoni, Black does not have the same queenside pawn majority for
counterplay. The disadvantage of this system is that while White's pawns are
further advanced with concomitant space gain, the pawns are also symmetrically
arranged. Sometimes all the heavy pieces are traded on the e-file with a
subsequent draw. This is why, if White wants to win at all costs, I recommend
the Martz Variation, which has no inherent drawishness. On the other hand, the
Liz Variation can be a relatively safe line of the Four Pawns Attack (if safe
and FPA can be put together!), and White still gets good winning chances in a
slightly more controlled environment. --- This chapter will be concerned with
the basic Liz tabiya reached after the 9th move as stated above - note that I
suggest a different move order from the Martz Variation. The reason is that
here, since White plans d5 anyway, there is no reason to make sure the Maróczy
Bind is possible. In other words, after 1 d4 Nf6 2 c4 g6 3 Nc3 Bg7 4 e4 d6 5
f4 the early 5...c5 (which prevents the Martz) is nothing here since White
just plays 6 d5, heading for the mainline Liz. Furthermore, playing this move
order has two more advantages: if Black plays a deferred Benko, White has
reserved development of his light-squared bishop, which often goes to c4 or b5
in this system - and here can make that jump in one move (see Game 32). The
other advantage is that sometimes Black makes an opening inaccuracy which lets
White play his bishop to d3 in one move (see Game 33). --- If Black plays
accurately, and White aims for it, the Liz tabiya will be reached, and so
after 9 exd5 Black has to form a plan of defence.} -- ({Games 23, 24 and 25
feature the obvious and most popular counters} 9... Re8) ({and} 9... Bf5 {,
where Black seeks counterplay on the open e-file.}) ({Games 26 and 27 feature
the very interesting blockade idea,} 9... Nh5 {, where Black prepares to
exchange his Indian bishop to damage White's pawn structure. Finally, Games 28
and 29 feature unusual 9th moves for Black. --- By the way, in case you're
wondering about the name of the variation, here's a quick explanation. For the
other three main lines in this book, the name of the variation was clear: the
Martz Variation, Knezevic Variation, Keres Variation. In each of these a
specific well-known player either originated or championed the line, and
played it repeatedly with success. So there was no conflict or indecision -
these masters' names had to go with the variation, it was that simple. However,
the line with 9 exd5 had no such champion. A lot of well-known players have
dabbled with the line, but none played it consistently. No strong player
racked up a string of wins with the variation like Martz or Keres, no one
seemed to be the originator and champion of the line like Knezevic. The line
apparently developed almost by accident, and no one paid a lot of attention.
None of the books I consulted on this line gave it a name, so I had to come up
with something! --- At this point I looked over and observed how great my wife
Liz looks in a miniskirt! I considered calling the line the "Miniskirt
Variation" but that seemed to sell it short, so to speak - therefore,
following my muse, I have named this line the Liz Variation!}) *

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 O-O 5. Be2 {Until I began writing and
researching this book, I didn't understand the importance of move order in the
Four Pawns Attack.} ({Knowing what I do now, I would have played} 5. f4 {to
head for the Liz Variation. The reason will become clear on the 7th move.})
5... c5 6. d5 {Heading for the Liz Variation.} ({As I explained in Chapter 1,
if you want the Martz, one should play} 6. Nf3 {here.}) 6... d6 7. f4 e6 ({At
this point Black could have taken advantage of my slightly inaccurate move
order by playing a delayed Benko with} 7... b5 {. Since in this opening (see
Game 32 for the correct move order) the f1-bishop almost never develops to e2,
but must usually capture on b5 or travel to the more active square c4 (which
will be freed when White plays cxb5) then, in effect, by playing the early Be2
and combining it with d5 (one recalls Be2 is correct when heading for the
Martz, with no d5), White has lost a tempo. --- However, my opponent doesn't
go for this wrinkle - and tempo or no, Black would have to sacrifice a pawn -
and so the mainline Liz is reached.}) 8. Nf3 exd5 9. exd5 Re8 {The most
logical and popular move: Black observes there is a single open file and puts
a rook on it.} 10. O-O {Boleslavsky writes that while White has a space
advantage, his f4-pawn cramps his own position, blocking the queen's bishop -
so his conclusion is that only if White successfully advances or sacrifices
this pawn can he get an advantage - and conversely, Black must aim at
blockading on f5. I am the first to say that I love the f5-advance for White 
(in fact it comes in strongly in this game, and once again I'll give this
attacking blow an exclam) but it's not the only feature in the position. One
shouldn't forget that, because of the c4/d5 pawn chain, White has an advantage
in space on the queenside and may play on that side of the board as well. Also,
the queen's bishop (as in Game 27, Inkiov-Lapiccirella) may become active via
Bd2-e1-h4, without moving the f-pawn. Yet it is true that of all White's plans
the f5-break is most immediately dangerous, and Black's first problem is to
stop this attacking move.} Ng4 ({For} 10... Bf5 {see the next game.}) 11. h3 {
Boleslavsky finds this illogical but best: White drives the black knight where
it seems to want to go, but gains an important developing tempo (Qd2) toward
bringing the a1-rook into play. Note that in most variations of the King's
Indian, White should not exchange his dark-squared bishop, as this often
allows the Indian bishop to become strong - but in the Liz Variation this
exchange is fairly common, as White will attack on the light squares with Bd3
and f5, while Black's fianchetto may be reduced to attacking empty space.} ({

to make a distinction between 1962, when this game was played, and today. As I
mentioned at the end of Chapter 1, Grandmasters used to draw these positions 
(as Uhlmann does here) but that was with a slower time control and
adjournments. Imagine defending Black's position in a rapid game or even G/2!
Black has two static weaknesses, the pawn at f5 and the square e6, while White
has space and attacking chances; Black has no active play, while White can
manoeuvre around forever. Therefore I say that while in 1962 the position
might be a "slight advantage to White", in 2006 the very same position should
be evaluated "clear advantage to White". Who could hold this position with
Black in a sudden death time control? --- Back in 1962, the game concluded as

to infiltrate on the queenside, Black draws as follows: he places the king at
e7, plays ...a5, gives up the b-pawn but places the bishop at c3. Once Black
sets up this fortress White can make no progress. --- It's important to note
that while Uhlmann held the draw, nowhere in the game did Black threaten.

defensive move, alien to the spirit of the opening, and soon gets a very very

{The old main lines of the Liz Variation (Games 23-25) offer, at best, a
difficult struggle for Black. If White plays actively (unlike Wade in Game 25!)
Black will get a difficult, joyless position that he may draw - but probably
won't in the one session game era. The old guard like Uhlmann made draws in
these lines, but who is prepared to defend such difficult positions today? And
who even knows those old lines - note that the high-rated GM Smirin was dead
lost by move 20 in Game 24. --- The blockade variation with 9...Nh5 holds up
somewhat better. If White allows Black to carry out his plan (...Bxc3 and ...f5) Black gets a safe position that he shouldn't lose and might win. White's
best chance is to play in gambit style with 10 Bd2 as in Game 26. The pawn
sacrifice is certainly sound, but if Black mixes it up with 10...Bd4, there
are almost no games in the database and the position is unclear - unless
perhaps my untried 11 Na4!? can nail down a small plus for White. --- The last
two games of the chapter feature bad lines and dubious experiments. White, if
he knows his business, should get a clear advantage against both ...Bg4 and
the delayed Benko.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. f4 O-O 6. Nf3 c5

{In this chapter I toss out some odds and ends. Let's say you don't want any
kind of main line (whether you're White or Black) - how can you avoid the
basic tabiyas and still get a reasonable game? For White that's not such a
difficult task: This and the next game feature the rare, but playable} 1. d4
Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. f4 {,} O-O 6. Bd3 {line. --- I must state
right out front that I don't think Bd3 is the best move (either Be2 or Nf3,
depending on your taste or mood, give White good chances for advantage), for
the simple reason that it leaves the central d-pawn undefended. However 6 Bd3
is a terrific surprise weapon (in Game 30 I defeat Susan Polgar in 19 moves!)
and it's no more risky than anything else in the Four Pawns Attack. If Black
knows (or can figure out at the board) the correct response, White can still
count on comfortable equality, with chances for more if Black goes wrong - and
the position is surprisingly difficult for Black to play, even though he can
gain a tempo in the opening. --- However, for Black to deviate from the
accepted lines - with those four menacing pawns staring at him - is a
different story. It's pretty hard to find a sound offbeat line. The most
played of the unusual variations is the delayed Benko Gambit (see Game 32),
but I don't see Black getting anything close to equality - even top players
like Shirov desperately struggle to draw, and White's wins run over 60%. ---
Finally, I will conclude the chapter - and the King's Indian part of this book
- with one more object lesson on the subject of quiet play vs. the Four Pawns
Attack.} *

correct move order, not committing the light-squared bishop, since he plans to
answer ...c5 with d5. This is particularly important when fighting (as here)

answer 9...axb5 with 10 Bxb5, developing with no loss of time.} O-O 6. Nf3 c5

avoid this position, so let's take stock: White has an extra pawn. Unlike in
the true Benko, White has no development problems with the light-squared
bishop. White will be able to castle easily. The queenside is fairly well
blocked, so Black can't get the usual a- and b-file pressure with his rooks.
All in all, White is clearly better, and the results in the database are
overwhelmingly in White's favour. --- This is not a line where one needs to
know variations, but rather the general plan, which is as follows: White holds
the pawn on the queenside, and then, while Black is occupied trying to win
that pawn back, White should attack the kingside in typical Four Pawns Attack
style. If Black turns his forces back for defence, White can utilize his extra
pawn - if Black is too obsessed with getting his pawn back, just mate him! ---

Now White wins! What's going on? I would be the first to admit I haven't a
clue, but there is a reason why I've gone so far afield in showing these three
games - because they show exactly what it takes to play main lines these days,
even in a casual team tournament. --- I congratulate Mr. Lee on his good
memory, but where was his chess play? Did he think at all, come up with any
original combination? I pity Mr. Chapa, but without a database in his head, he
had no business playing down the main line of the Grünfeld. --- The last two
games show that if you want to play this line, the critical area of
investigation is at move thirty-one! Can you imagine, even conceive of how
many variations and subvariations you would have to memorize to play an
opening where the original moves begin at move thirty-one? --- For the average
player that number, that astronomical number, is simply impossible. You would
spend every waking moment at the computer, just crunching lines that have
already been played. And where is the fun, where is the creativity? If one
wins a game solely because you memorized better - if you win a game without
making a single original move - then what satisfaction will you feel upon
winning? --- This book was already in the works when I saw the Lee-Chapa game,
but it convinced me quite thoroughly that I was on the right track. The only
way to play fun and interesting chess games these days is to play slightly
offbeat, less analyzed and, above all, less fashionable variations. ---
Therefore I offer two lines to beat the Grünfeld, namely the Knezevic: 1 d4
Nf6 2 c4 g6 3 Nc3 d5 4 e3 Bg7 5 Qb3, which is the subject of Chapters 5 and 6;
and the Keres: 1 d4 Nf6 2 c4 g6 3 Nc3 d5 4 Nf3 Bg7 5 e3 0-0 6 cxd5 Nxd5 7 Bc4,
analyzed in Chapters 7 and 8. --- I have a strict criteria for variations I
play these days (and I would not recommend the lines if I did not play them -
one sees my own games sprinkled throughout the book). The lines have to be
sound, and they have to be unfashionable! --- The Knezevic and Keres
Variations hit the Daily Double on the above criteria, so let's have some fun
- enjoy a few novel chess ideas - and forget memorization!} 1-0

First,} 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4 Nxc3 6. bxc3 Bg7 7. Bc4 c5 {was seen in a couple of
Spassky-Fischer games and, as already related, has become so popular the lines
are booked up over 30 moves. We see the typical ...c5-break on move seven -
Black chips away at White's centre, and accentuates the power of his
fianchettoed bishop.}) ({Another typical and popular line starts as follows:} 
4. Bf4 Bg7 {. If you want high level endorsement, this line has it! The
position above has been played (either with White or Black or both) by Lasker,
Capablanca, Alekhine, Euwe, Botvinnik, Smyslov, Tal, Petrosian, Fischer,
Karpov and Kasparov - that is to say, practically every official World
Champion. But before you get all excited about this, let's take a look at a
current high level game (see the following game).}) *

notice is that Black successfully gets his ...c5-break in on move five - in
other words, Black may feel comfortable in his kind of opening: this line is
very much a typical Grünfeld. --- The second thing to notice is the note to
White's 23rd move: at this point the daring Bulgarian GM went off on his own 
(!) with the innovation 23 f4! This was too much excitement for both players,
and they agreed to a draw next move and - OK, OK, I've already made one of my
points: popular, fashionable lines blessed by World Champions are booked up
beyond what any reasonable person can handle. However, my other point, that
both the Exchange Variation and the Bf4 variation allow Black to almost
equalize with a near immediate ...c5, is often overlooked.} (24. -- {By
playing 5 Qb3, White says Nyet! to the immediate ...c5, and puts so much
pressure on Black so fast that the best move is supposed to be the
self-blocking 5...e6 - but I say, if you make your opponent block his queen's
bishop and simultaneously prevent his usual counterplay, you're way ahead of
the game already! --- This chapter deals with the position reached after 5...e6 (all other defences will be considered in Chapter 6) 6 Qa3, which is the
natural next step: White prevents Black from castling. Games 34, 35 and 36
deal with Black's most popular counter, the manoeuvre ...Nc6-e7, which enables
castling. Games 37 and 38 deal with Black's attempts to force a draw, or a
drawn endgame, with the blunt counters 6...Bf8 and 6...Qe7. Finally, Game 39
deals with the long-winded but interesting idea of 6...c6, 7...a5, 8...Na6 and
finally 9...Nb4, which also finally blocks the white queen.}) 1/2-1/2

11. Bd2 {and White has the usual pull with good queenside play, while Black
has nothing much on the kingside and has been unable to activate his
fianchettoed bishop.}) 8. Bd3 {Generally speaking, White has a slight edge
here: more space, a potential c-file initiative, and smooth development; while
Black has kingside weaknesses because the ...g6/...e6 combination doesn't go
together, and both the queen's knight and queen's bishop are inactive. --- The
text is one of three good bishop moves (8 Be2, Game 35, and 8 Bd2, Game 36,
are the others) all of which give White a plus. The interesting thing is that,
while these three typical bishop developing moves have a superficial
similarity, White has to choose a distinct and different plan for each line -
for example, after developing the bishop to d3, White should be looking to
expand in the centre with e4, which also activates the dark-squared bishop.
--- At the time this game was played, I had not yet delved into the precise
differentiation of the opening moves, and so I followed Bd3 with the Minority
Attack (suitable only after 8 Be2) and this mixture of systems allowed my
opponent to first equalize and then take the initiative. (Note to self: Study
first! Don't use a game against a 2600+ GM as a learning experience!)} ({By
the way, another 8th move possibility should be noted:} 8. c5 {gains space,
but White has no targets. This push is better once Black has played ...b6,
when White has a point of attack (see note to White's 10th move). Here Black
can find adequate counterplay on the kingside, e.g.} O-O 9. b4 Ng4 10. h3 Nh6
11. Bd3 Nef5 12. O-O Nh4 13. Nxh4 Qxh4 14. b5 e5 15. Nxd5 Bxh3 {and Black's
attack is good enough to draw.}) 8... O-O 9. O-O b6 (9... c6 {has also been
played, but I have a philosophical problem with this move in the Grünfeld
Defence. As I mentioned in the introduction - and anyone who studies the
Grünfeld soon learns this - the fundamental Black counter to White's pawn
centre is to play ...c5, which pawn break accentuates the power of Black's
fianchettoed bishop. What happens when Black plays ...c6 in this opening? The
counter ...c5 is at best delayed and a tempo is lost - at worst, Black never
gets the move in at all! I might be exaggerating here, but I don't know a
single Grünfeld variation where Black's position is improved by an early ...c6.
The usual effect of ...c6 is that the position becomes more static, more
closed - Black loses chances for dynamic counterplay. In general, Grünfeld
lines with ...c6 tend to be passive, defensive systems (like the Schlechter
Slav/Grünfeld lines seen in Chapter Eight) where Black opts for "safety" but
allows White a persistent advantage. This type of line gives White a high
winning percentage, and Black only a middling drawing percentage, with no real
winning chances for the second player. --- Going back to this game and the
position after 9...c6, one sees that this passive move allows White to
immediately seize the initiative in the centre:} 10. e4 dxe4 11. Nxe4 Nxe4 12.

this opening, is not ready for such peace overtures and puts Black in check.

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. e3 Bg7 5. Qb3 e6 6. Qa3 Qe7 {Unlike the
previous game, where Black's 6th move said, "Please, Sir, may I have a draw
now?", this offer to exchange queens says, "I want a draw and I'm willing to
defend for a while - I don't think you can win this with queens off!" --- But
White has no reason not to exchange queens, for the ending favours the first
player. There are quite a few advantages: First, White will get his
dark-squared bishop to the a3-f8 diagonal, where this theoretically "bad"
bishop will become so strong that it will practically have to be exchanged,
leaving Black weak on the dark squares. Next, White has the aggressive
formation in the centre with a bit more space, and while it would rarely be
good for Black to surrender his central toehold with ...dxc4, Black will have
to watch on every move in case cxd5 favours White. Finally, White can operate
on the kingside as well with a possible h4-h5. In short, White has various
positional advantages and board-wide play. All this does not make for a huge
advantage with queens off, but Black must face a very difficult defensive task,
while he has no winning chances whatsoever - meanwhile White can play all
night! --- This brings up an important point, that may be disconcerting to my
readers who have just finished the first part of this book: the King's Indian,
mate him with the Four Pawns Attack part! There White often plays for direct
attack. The lines I recommend against the Grünfeld are more positional in
nature. There are sharp chances for an opening advantage, but sometimes the
advantage can only be realized in the endgame (see Game 50, Taylor-Pomerleano).
While I like straightforward attacking lines, in the Grünfeld Defence these
mainly occur in the Exchange Variation which, as I've mentioned, is booked up
past absurdity. So let's show our versatility and crush our foes positionally!}

{The main line (inasmuch as this quite new opening has a main line) where
Black plays 6...Nc6 and 7...Ne7 gives White good chances for positional
advantage. 8 Bd3 combined with e4 (Game 34), 8 Be2 combined with b4 and a
Minority Attack (Game 35), and 8 Bd2 combined with Rc1 and queenside pressure 
(Game 36) all give White at least a small positional advantage. White must
beware of minority attack positions where Black is able to answer b4 with ...b5 and a subsequent knight manoeuvre to c4 - if this is accomplished, Black
will have no worries and might even take over the advantage. However, careful
play in all three lines should give White a pull. I personally think the best
chances for a significant edge lie with the moves 8 Bd3 and 8 Bd2 - Black has
good drawing chances against 8 Be2 if he captures in the centre with his
knight. --- When Black plays for a draw with 6...Bf8 or 6...Qe7, he
essentially limits his ambitions to a half point. White can press for victory
with minimal risk and Black's chances of drawing are probably less than his
chances of losing. --- Finally, the complicated knight and pawns manoeuvre of
Game 39 - where Black tries to block on b4 - should fail against
straightforward development (as opposed to Korchnoi contortions) when White
has good queenside pressure. --- I don't see any line in this chapter that
guarantees Black equality, though there are many "slight plus to White"
positions that can only be evaluated - patiently - in the ending. --- If you
were ready for a fiery Four Pawns Attack, and your opponent crossed you up by
playing the Grünfeld, you have to make a mental adjustment and be ready to
play a 55 move endgame grind!} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. e3 Bg7 5. Qb3 e6

this is not appealing to all Grünfeld players, so other 5th moves have been
tried; but one must note that, because of White's strong threat to take on d5,
Black's choice is severely limited. For example, the otherwise natural} 5...

pawn can be seen.}) ({Black has three reasonable tries besides 5...e6, namely} 
5... dxc4 {(Game 40)}) (5... c5 {(Game 41)}) ({and} 5... c6 {(Game 42). The
last of these is a defensive move similar to 5...e6; Black settles for a
slightly worse game, and White need not lose sleep over such a move. --- The
other two are more interesting: 5...dxc4 gives White a development tempo, but
unlike in Chapter 5, Black castles with ease. I sympathize with 5...c5 - Black
fights back with the traditional Grünfeld counter, but must (at least
temporarily) sacrifice a pawn in the process. --- Note that these are rare
lines in a rare opening, so the variations are quite unexplored. Let's step
off the beaten path and take a look!}) *

White did not play a "Knezevic" move order - and that Black missed a smooth

compensation for White's doubled, isolated pawns - but that's not the real
reason, which is 1331! Yes, 1331 games in the database with that 7th move

order given above, likewise after White's 7th move? Answer: no games. --- So
if you really want to play 6 cxd5 in the Knezevic move order above, you need
to study an entirely different opening - the Caro-Kann - and become familiar
with at least some of 1331 games! Maybe this is just me, but I'd rather take
the untrodden path - which in my opinion gives more chances for advantage than
playing against the booked-up Caro anyway - and just try to figure out the
best move. Or in other words, think with your own head!}) 4... Bg7 5. e3 O-O 6.

of Korchnoi's games - one he lost, and one he drew. I personally don't think
the mighty Viktor has the feel for the Knezevic - his play seems heavy-handed,
when the opening demands a light touch. Here he loses again, once more to a

Black's rooks are not connected, and this suggests that White might have a
forced win, given the accumulated advantages - let's lay them out

generally (for now!) helpless state of development, not to mention the weak

1 d4 d5 2 c4 c6 3 Nc3 Nf6 4 e3 g6 5 Nf3 Bg7 6 Qb3. This transposition will be
discussed in Chapter 8. --- In the present game, Ehlvest tries to take
advantage of the fact that his king's knight is not developed, and so
manoeuvres it to f4, placing pressure on the black d-pawn. I think this is an
interesting idea, but a little over-elaborate, since the Schlechter Slav
positions favour White anyway, without such knight wanderings. But Ehlvest
apparently feels happy with the ever so slow, Petrosian-style manoeuvring game
he creates, and he does finally take the full point!}) 6... cxd5 ({In the

{In Taylor-Khachian we can see that the main game (and the similar
Zagorskis-Brinck Claussen win given in the notes) is quite difficult for Black,
but the 7th move alternatives, particularly 7...a6, are still so unexplored
there may be improvements for both sides. --- Black's pawn sacrifice with ...c5 in Game 41 does not lead to equality: White can give the pawn back at the
right time to gain a development edge. --- Finally, the Slav system seen in
Game 42 should be met with the natural Nf3, when White is better as will be
seen in Chapter 8. The actual line Ehlvest played, with the king's knight
moving twice, allows Black to break out with gambit play. The main reason
Black lost was that he tried to play as quietly as his foe, instead of taking
his chances for sharp counterattack.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. e3 Bg7 5.

{The Keres Variation begins with these moves:} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4.
Nf3 Bg7 5. e3 O-O 6. cxd5 Nxd5 7. Bc4 {. This is the only system in the book 
(both in the King's Indian and Grünfeld part) where, so far as I can see,
there is a clear path to equality for Black: namely the line seen in Game 45,
Najdorf-Korchnoi, where Black counters with} Nxc3 8. bxc3 c5 9. O-O Qc7 {.
Korchnoi's line leads to a dynamically equal (but not drawish) position. ---
Therefore I suggest the Knezevic Variation for full strength opening advantage
against the Grünfeld, and the Keres line for surprise value. Given the line's
rarity in present day play, most Grünfeld players (who have been staying up
nights memorizing the Exchange Variation) will be surprised - but even if not,
White can obtain a solid, even position - and just play chess! --- Keres
himself did not claim White got any advantage: he called his variation "a
modest system" that reached a position "which is not without problems for both
sides". His main reason for playing his line was to avoid booked-up variations
- as he said in 1972 of the then popular Taimanov variation (4 Bg5): "this has
been played too much in recent months to be successful." --- Despite these
"modest" goals, one should note that Keres had a lifetime score of four wins
and two draws with his line, which is a result we all could envy!} *

{This is an extremely heavyweight encounter between two players who were, at
the time, among the very best in the world.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nf3 Bg7 4.
Nc3 d5 5. e3 O-O 6. cxd5 Nxd5 7. Bc4 {The inaugural game with this system - so
some might wonder why I call it the Keres System rather than Rubinstein.
However, Rubinstein only played it twice, while Keres played the system
throughout his career with great success.} Nxc3 {The most popular and, in my
opinion, the best move. Grünfeld himself played this way. Black meets the
attack on his knight without loss of time, and immediately follows with the
standard counter ...c5 (a move that was so difficult for Black to achieve in
the Knezevic Variation).} (7... Nb6 {and other deviations from this main line
will be covered in Chapter 8.}) 8. bxc3 c5 9. O-O {The basic Keres tabiya has
been reached. Here Black has achieved the standard Grünfeld ...c5 break, but
White's centre is more solid than in Exchange Variation lines, as the e-pawn
has stopped at e3 (though this blocks White's dark-squared bishop). Sometimes
Black tries to attack the d-pawn again with ...e5, but must then risk the
formation of a protected passed pawn for White, as the first player can follow
with d5 and c4. --- Another interesting feature of the position is that while
White's dark-squared bishop is blocked from a "normal" development on the
c1-h6 diagonal, the piece often finds a home on a3, where under the right
circumstances it can become very strong, bearing down on Black's king position.

shuts out the Grünfeld bishop; White has pressure on the c-file right now, and
one can imagine kingside attacking chances later with moves like Ng5 or h4-h5.
Of the five games in the database with this position, Black lost four and
scored but a single draw. In the remaining games of this chapter, we will see
how modern players try to prevent White from achieving this model set-up.} b5

bad piece, the (at this point) virtually immobile queen's bishop. Once the
exchange occurs, this bishop gains vital range and the thrust d5 will always

{This game is the critical line of the whole Keres Variation. In this battle
between two world class players, Black succeeds in clearly equalizing the game.
There may be nothing much for White here, but I found an interesting game
where White tried to improve with 11 Bd5 and did indeed get a small edge -
though I also found a key improvement for Black which might send the position
back to equal-land! Black players should pay close attention to the "move
order" note to Black's 11th move, which looks like a good (but so far rarely
tried) system of defence, in which Black gives up the two bishops to double

queen's veiled attack, while moving to a useful diagonal where it attacks b7

this book's author to find the best move for both sides, or the best plan, and

refute either myself or Korchnoi in this game, so the verdict still stands -
at the time of this writing - as equal. --- But as I said in the beginning of
the chapter, Keres didn't play this variation to force some sharp theoretical
edge: he played it to avoid theory while obtaining a rich middlegame, and this

position is as new as it was to Alekhine in 1922! And a very logical move
would be to develop a minor piece to attack the centre - which explains why

look at lines where Black does not play the natural Grünfeld move 8...c5.
These lines have an artificial aspect, and often lose time - Black usually
finds out he can't do without ...c5 after all, and plays it with a delay.
White should be prepared for this type of defence, since Black may be
unfamiliar with the Keres line and will seek to avoid "book" - but the famous

{What is White aiming for in the mainline Keres? The reader should take
careful note of three positions: after 12 Rc1 in Game 43, Rubinstein-Alekhine;
after 18 cxd4 in Game 44, Keres-Malich; and after 11 cxd4 in Game 46,
Keres-Ekutimishvili. All these positions have two factors in common: Black has
already captured with ...cxd4, so there is no pressure on White's centre, and
both White's bishops are active. If you can get this sort of position, you can
be happy! Usually Keres would win such games with a kingside attack, often
employing moves like h4-h5 and Qe3, targeting the weak dark squares around the
black king. --- The only problem with this rosy scenario is that these
"perfect" positions cannot be forced! The proverbial fly in the ointment is
the terrible Mr. Korchnoi himself, who figured out how to equalize against the
Keres system back in 1971 (Najdorf-Korchnoi, Game 45), and I haven't been able
to find any worthwhile improvement (though I did find an alternate equalizing
plan - see the "move order note" at move 11). The critical position in
Najdorf-Korchnoi is after 11...Nd7. Note the black knight developed in one
move to an excellent square where it defends the c5-pawn and so blocks White's
dark-squared bishop. Furthermore, Black has no intention of taking on c4 until
he himself is doubled on the c-file - while White is hampered by his own pawn
at c3. Try as I might, I can't find any plus for White here. --- What should
you do if your opponent knows how to play this line? One should note that the
ending reached where Najdorf and Korchnoi agreed a draw is equal but by no
means dead, given the unbalanced pawn structure. One could certainly play this
on and try to outplay your opponent. However, I must honestly admit that in
the future I will only be employing the Keres Variation on rare occasions, for
surprise value, now that I know Black can reach equality following a fairly
clear sequence. --- I repeat that Keres himself never claimed his line gave
White any advantage; he used it just to get out of book and get into a rich
middlegame. If you look at it that way, you can have fun with this - and
besides, who knows Najdorf-Korchnoi, Hastings 1971/72 anyway? --- One final
note: The last two games of this chapter feature lines that the White player
will be happy to meet! If Black delays the standard Grünfeld counterplay with ...c5, first of all White gains time, and second, Black will soon find he has
no play at all until he comes up with ...c5 after all! I think that in Game 47,
Golz-Tukmakov, White can practically overrun Black with the rare but strong 9
h4!, while even the solid game line gives White a pleasant plus. --- Likewise
in Game 48, Nei-Gurgenidze, White can simply occupy the centre and secure a
solid advantage where Black can only hope to draw.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3

only problem with the methods of avoidance we will see here is that the main
line (particularly Game 45, Najdorf-Korchnoi) is Black's best choice! --- The
White player interested in "beating the Grünfeld", however, should be prepared
for all lines, so to begin with I consider the "best of the rest", namely the
retreat 7...Nb6 (Games 49-51), while touching on inferior 7th moves like 7...c6 - you all know my opinion of this kind of move in the Grünfeld! - and the
other, also doubtful protections, ...e6 and ...Be6. --- Finally, I will wrap
up the book with a quick look at the Schlechter Slav. Depending on how you
look at it, this might not be a Grünfeld at all, but as it can be reached by
transposition - and I have had more than one opponent prefer this passive Slav
line to the Grünfeld, when they guess I have a prepared variation ready - then
the White player must in turn be prepared for this eventuality. --- The good
news is there is not a lot of theory to learn: White scores a high winning
percentage against the Schlechter Slav with easy and natural moves. And as I
say for the millionth time, the fianchettoed dark-squared bishop does not go
well with the c6/d5 pawn formation, as Black needs the ...c5-break to activate
his bishop.} *

respect to the master of this variation, I have to disagree. In the 7...Nxc3
variation, Black can equalize with a few accurate moves, and will then have
reasonable counterplay. In the 7...Nb6 variation, White gets a prolonged
initiative, while Black will be forced onto the defensive for the foreseeable
future. --- Although White's advantage is not great in the 7...Nb6 lines, the
difference to a practical player is quite large: Black has to defend and
suffer, while with Korchnoi's 7...Nxc3, Black can find his own play. In other
words, I say 7...Nxc3 is the better move, rather than a matter of taste.

and all his minor pieces are developed. Here White's d-pawn is free to advance
and seize central space, while Black still has to complete his development.
Also, White's light-squared bishop is extremely active on b3, aiming at the
king and helping the isolani move forward, while Bareev's bishop was still
languishing on e2. --- The pawns may be the "soul of chess" - the basic pawn
structure of both games is identical - but the pieces matter! Here White's far
superior development more than compensates for the isolated pawn - or perhaps
better said, makes the isolani a strong central pawn rather than a weakness -

White only a tiny edge here (approximately +0.15), but I think, from a human

quality: "play". White can play this position all night without weakening his
game. He can feint down the a-file, he can gesture toward h6, he can double on
the e-file, he can try to bring up forces to attack the black king - and all
Black can do is try to parry at the right time. It's not surprising that Byrne

ending that could have resulted in the game (see note to move 30).The question
is, does Black want to play this difficult defence? Both the middlegame of

{The last two games of the book feature the Schlechter Slav, or Slav/Grünfeld,
which is a strange hybrid indeed! I can't resist quoting Chris Ward from his
excellent recent book, 'Play the Queen's Gambit': "We are entering what is
commonly referred to as the Slav Grünfeld, which in itself is almost a
contradiction of terms, as in their purest forms you probably couldn't find
two more opposite defences. The former bolsters the centre and doesn't usually
budge an inch, whilst the second typically donates the opponent a big centre
only to strike back at it later!" --- I couldn't have said it better myself,

Black forever of the ...c5-break) 6...cxd5 7 Qb3 Nc6 8 Bd3 0-0 9 0-0 and the

is how to develop his queen's bishop, and two is how to make his passive

O-O e6 $6 {This terrible move has been played by World Champions Tal, Smyslov
and Euwe, by the esteemed Paul Keres, and here of course Timman. This is the
kind of "Grandmaster" move I simply don't understand. Just look at it:
obviously the move blocks in Black's light-squared bishop, while weakening the
dark squares around his king. I think that's enough to brand the move as a
positional error, but one could always ask Mr. Fritz... The computer gives
White a small advantage up to this point, but after 7...e6?! the advantage
doubles to clear advantage, almost a point up. I would add that none of the
fine players mentioned above ever won a single game with this line, though
they did eke out some draws (the total score of the above-mentioned group was
3½/9).} ({I think if you asked any 2000-rated player the first three
candidate moves he could find in the position after 7 0-0, he would never
include 7...e6 in his thoughts, because it's so obviously bad. Certainly ...Bg4, ...Bf5, and ...Be6 could be considered, even ...Nbd7 might cross his mind.
If he looks deeply into the position, he might see that a move like 7...Bg4
can be met by cxd5 and Qb3, which might give him the idea for 7...dxc4
followed by a bishop development (incidentally, Ward gives this as the main
line, but correctly sees a White advantage after} 7... dxc4 8. Bxc4 Bg4 9. h3
Bxf3 10. Qxf3 {when the two bishops give White a plus). But in all cases Black
would want (at least if Black were not hampered by a world title) to keep the
possibility of developing the queen's bishop in Slav fashion on the open
diagonal. --- Now the mystery gets deeper. Earlier in the same year that
Kasparov-Timman was played, Timman was White in this same position vs. the
Russian GM Salov. Salov followed the World Champions and played the terrible 7.
..e6, and Timman crushed him easily, never even letting him into the game (the
full game follows). And not only that! Years before, in 1968, Timman had faced
the ever dubious 7...e6, and crushed the hapless Zara in 23 moves! --- Now we
come to our main game. Timman plays Kasparov, with reversed colours. He
decides to follow the World Champions, and Salov, whom he has just beaten, and
Zara, whom he beat even earlier - just so he can get the same bad position!
Did he think then World Champion Kasparov needed some extra help in the
opening??}) ({While I think White is better anyway, because of the ...g6/...c6

{The 7...Nb6, 8...c5 line seen in Games 49 and 50 is certainly playable, but
White gets a persistent edge. Basically Black can suffer either in the
middlegame (Game 49) or the endgame (Game 50). In my opinion the latter offers
Black the best drawing chances, but it's a thankless chore. Meanwhile White
has all the chances, and risks very little. --- The lines where Black plays in
Grünfeld style and then avoids ...c5 (Game 51) are inferior as usual. White
can usually get a nice positional grind game, as Portisch showed. --- The last
two games simply show that the Slav/Grünfeld marriage is not a match made in
heaven! For some reason the line is fairly popular, but White has any number
of ways to get a solid edge - Black has essentially eliminated his own
counterplay by stopping his c-pawn at c6! --- Finally, just because World
Champions have for years played a certain opening move doesn't mean said
opening move is any good!} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. Nf3 Bg7 5. e3 O-O (
