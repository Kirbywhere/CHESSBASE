{This series provides an ideal platform to study chess openings. By
continually challenging the reader to answer probing questions throughout the
book, the Move by Move format greatly encourages the learning and practising
of vital skills just as much as the traditional assimilation of opening
knowledge. Carefully selected questions and answers are designed to keep you
actively involved and allow you to monitor your progress as you learn. This is
an excellent way to study any chess opening and at the same time improve your
general chess skills and knowledge. --- Bird's Opening,} 1. f4 {, is an ideal
choice for freethinking chess players who prefer to rely on their general
chess knowledge and intuition rather than having to memorize and keep up to
date with mainline opening theory. Bird's Opening is essentially the Dutch
Defence with an extra move, and White can choose between a number of different
set-ups, including the reversed Leningrad, Classical and Stonewall variations,
depending on mood and opponents' responses. In this book, International Master
Cyrus Lakdawala examines all the important variations of Bird's Opening,
including the sharp From's Gambit. Using illustrative games, he explains the
main positional and tactical ideas for both sides, provides answers to all the
key questions and tells you everything you need to know about successfully
playing 1 f4.} (1. -- {Cyrus Lakdawala is an International Master, a former
National Open and American Open Champion, and a six-time State Champion. He

{Move by Move is a series of opening books which uses a question-and-answer
format. One of our main aims of the series is to replicate - as much as
possible - lessons between chess teachers and students. --- All the way
through, readers will be challenged to answer searching questions and to
complete exercises, to test their skills in chess openings and indeed in other
key aspects of the game. It's our firm belief that practising your skills like
this is an excellent way to study chess openings, and to study chess in
general. --- Many thanks go to all those who have been kind enough to offer
inspiration, advice and assistance in the creation of Move by Move. We're
really excited by this series and hope that readers will share our enthusiasm.

{When it comes to chess openings, your writer tends toward an abysmally low
tolerance to routine. Some of us play one set of openings our entire lives,
taking up the Ruy Lopez at age eight and passing from this world at age 90,
still essaying the Spanish Game. I, on the other hand, change openings like
articles of clothing. --- Every opening variation has its distinctive aroma
and feel. With} 1. f4 $1 {initiating the Bird's Opening, the flavour and smell
of course is of the Dutch Defence (whose intellectual property we openly
violate... or is it the Dutch which violates our intellectual property?), but
a tempo up, since we play it as White. --- The Chinese classical text, the Tao
Te Ching, commences with the phrase "The Tao that can be explained is not the
eternal Tao". Some positions are more about 'sense and feeling' than about
'analysis'. The Bird's is not an opening suited for corporate tastes. A friend
at the San Diego Chess Club, after hearing that I was writing a book on Bird's
Opening, told me (with a degree of malicious glee!) that Henry Bird, the
opening's founder, only managed a 47% score with his line as White. With our
first move, we seize control over the e5-square, in the hope of later
occupying it with a piece. In any experimental opening line like Bird's, we
have the stock horror movie character: the mad scientist, who risks tampering
with the forces of nature to satisfy scientific curiosity. When our opponents
refuse to believe a non-standard opening contains hidden potential - when it
actually does - they are like a person born blind, who is unable to grasp even
the concept of the existence of colour. Now very few of us play Bird's
exclusively as White, and I hereby suggest we play it as a side line or a
surprise weapon. Opening theory, as we all know, can be either a weapon or a
crutch. Why not stick to a mainstream, theoretical line, you may ask? The
answer is: frequent habitual repetition of an opening variation, played ad
nauseam, while allowing you to know it well, may also empty the variation of
all its adventure - and therefore its fun, which in turn deadens us to its
subtleties. --- Each time we agree to enter a theoretical opening duel (which
is really a duel of homework), our hands shake like a nervous vegan ninth
grade kid (whose parents are PETA members) who is forced to dissect a frog in
biology class. With 1 f4, this is unlikely to happen simply because the theory
remains rather stable, mainly since so few of us play the opening. I'm an
intuitive player at heart, and I deeply resent it when my opponent forces me
into that unpleasant task: Homework! With 1 f4, we operate on moods and
feelings, not hard variations, as most believe (though the From's Gambit would
be the sole exception). Because of the blessing/curse of constantly developing
technology, we all find ourselves struggling not to fall behind in a frantic
opening theory arms race. Our variations, played just yesterday by some GM
across the globe, are now instantly transferred to us to absorb and memorize.
Some of us try to avoid this techno-rat race by sub-specializing in just a few
positions. If you open with 1 f4! as White and meet all Queen's pawn openings
with 1...f5 with Black (for example, 1 Nf3 f5; 1 d4 f5; 1 c4 f5; 1 g3 f5), we
manage to cover 66.66% of all our openings with a single Bird's/Dutch overall
structure. --- Evolutionary mutations of a major opening line producing a
playable offshoot are uncommon in chess. In the case of the Bird's, its
offshoot - the Dutch - is oddly, far more popular than its intellectual
creator. We can use the Bird's unpopularity and weaponize it. In essence, we
chant a spell of theoretical concealment when we open with 1 f4!, which tends
to offend theory's officialdom. If we play the opening regularly, our eyes
slowly grow accustomed to the Dutch-like murk, while we hope to lure opponents
from their familiar world of rationality, into our world of confused
disassociation and illogic, where both sides must play almost by inference,
rather than direct decree. Your opponent can even study and prep for your
coming Bird's and still not play it very well, since when we play an
unfamiliar opening line, we can study it diligently at home, but on another
level, the play is tempered by experience, and our opponents are in a sense,
infants to the line - even when armed with theoretical knowledge.} (1. -- {
Let's take a look at some of our key battlegrounds. We must sort through the
thicket of Dutch expectations (played a move up), retaining some lines, while
perhaps choosing to discard others (see the following games).}) *

{"The time to hesitate is through. No time to wallow in the mire." --- Our
first position is that of From's Gambit, where we sense apocalyptic warning
signs everywhere. The learning of such a complex line is not simply an
affectation of the theoretically affluent. This isn't a wing-it style chapter
and we must know our theory as if our lives depend on it - because over the
board, they do. From's originates from} 1. f4 e5 $5 {, where Black's e-pawn
insolently looks in our direction and makes a neck-slicing gesture by dragging
a finger across its throat. So the opening choice to wilfully enter such a
position is for those with a contentious disposition, since Black in essence
declares war on us on move one with an immediate pawn sacrifice! --- My
feeling is that we should accept (and this too is backed up by the comps'
evaluations) Black gambit, with the philosophies: 1. If we are unable to
unlock a door, then the next best thing is to kick it down. --- 2. By
declining the gambit, we tend to transpose into an open game fight (1 f4 e5 2
e4) rather than a strategic tussle, and the former is exactly what the
opponent wants.} *

Come on! Two exclams for this rote combination which I would probably find in
a blitz game? --- ANSWER: The combination is rote, mainly since players like
Lasker were the (great!) predecessors who showed us the way. I got a recent
email from my longtime friend IM Jack Peters, who wrote the following: "I
recently went over the article about Labourdonnais vs. McDonnell in the March
2011 Chess Life. Three of McDonnell's wins were annotated, separately, by
Morphy, Anderssen and Paulsen. By modern standards, their annotations were
awful! Do you know if annotators had different customs then? For example, were
they reluctant to give tactical variations? Was it considered impolite to
point out errors? All three annotators mentioned beginner-level stuff and
ignored the critical moments of the games. I found Morphy's fulsome praise for
ordinary moves irritating. When he did try to pinpoint some mistakes, he was
often wrong! If I had to guess his strength based on his notes, I would not
consider him a great player." The answer to Jack's question is the same as the
answer to yours: That which is rote to the modern day club player, was all new
to the old guard. So we shouldn't judge them by modern day standards. Even
basic ideas like developing quickly and fighting for the centre were arcane
secrets, known only to a select few in the romantic era.} ({Note that} 15. Qxh5

{Free-thinking GMs continued Bird's idea, like Nimzowitsch, Tartakower, Larsen,
and current GMs Lars Karlsson, Mikhail Gurevich, Henrik Danielsen and Artur
Jakubiec. In recent years, the top exponents of the Bird's are Nakamura,
Nepomniachtchi and Rapport. I think Larsen did more than any other GM to
popularize the opening (it probably should be called the Bird-Larsen Attack).
Here is an example of Larsen's deviously subtle understanding of the opening.
--- Great players - both living and dead - leave indelible imprints upon our
minds, and by default, our play. Add to this our own uniqueness and we have a
constantly changing chess entity. This soft lump of clay alters and shifts
form throughout our chess lives. Bent Larsen's handling of 1 f4! had just such
an effect upon your writer. This is my favourite game in the book. I
originally placed it in Chapter 3 as a model example for the Classical Bird.
However, I liked it so much that I yanked it away and it thus got promoted to
the Introduction.} 1. f4 Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. d3 d5 4. e3 Bg7 5. Be2 O-O 6. O-O b6
7. Qe1 Bb7 8. Nbd2 {QUESTION: What is White's intent behind this move? ---
ANSWER: White plans a Nimzowitchian overprotection strategy of e5, with Ne5
and then Ndf3, backing up e5.} Nbd7 9. Qg3 $5 {When we engage in a flight of
fancy at the board, we should also attempt a kind of purposeful dreaming which
is functional, as well as aesthetically pleasing. A move which appears
self-evidently obvious to one player may look bizarrely idiosyncratic to
another. This kind of move was perfectly "normal" for Larsen. Already, this is
a new move in the position, though a typically odd Larsonian opening idea
which hasn't been repeated since. --- QUESTION: Why would a player so
acquainted with opening theory proceed to spit in its face by rejecting
conformity? What exactly does the queen do on g3? --- ANSWER: To answer your
first question: Larsen veers from theory to de-book and confuse opponents,
forcing them to play on their own, rather than rely on homework. To answer
your second question, 9 Qg3 suppresses Black's ...e5 break. Also, the queen
can easily transfer to h3, as it normally does in Qh4 lines, so White isn't
really giving up anything by playing his queen to g3.} ({A look at other

--- QUESTION: Didn't Larsen's queen lose a potential tempo on his last move?

knight. --- 2) White reacts with Qh3, where he kind of wants to go to anyway,
and then gains a useful tempo himself with g4 in booting the knight off the

{In this chapter, we deal with Black's most aggressive response to Bird's,
From's Gambit. From the get go, Black offers us a pawn for an instant
development lead and attacking chances. Now when I played} 1. f4 {online in
2005 to 2006, From's was the most common response from titled players. Today,
having taken up Bird's opening again, I haven't had a single From's Gambit
from a titled player - in fact, I haven't had anyone play it! The reason: It
is currently in theoretical disrepair and the fun-killing comps have pretty
much worked it out in White's favour. A gambit with the black pieces is a
tricky entity, since we as White already get a one move development head start,
which in turn decreases Black's compensation. Be warned though, at the club
level it is still quite popular. If you know your lines, you should be able to
pull out a clear advantage. Still, such positions, even though borderline
unsound for Black, are not so easy to play for our side, since we are thrown
on the defensive for such a long time. So even though we have an advantage
over the board, Black, in a certain sense, still retains the practical chances.
So let's not underestimate this line. Tossed into such murk, we deal in
"maybe" and "I'm-not-so-sure", more than fixed notions. Our difficulties can
be encapsulated into a single issue: King safety. If you test the positions
against the comps, taking Black, you will soon master the art of snatching
Black's gift pawn and converting it to the full point.} *

because it isn't as forcing as the 4...g5 lines, which in turn, gives White a
far greater development leeway.} 5. d4 {"In my opinion, White has only one
good move here, and that is the text," writes Taylor. --- QUESTION: Do you
agree? --- ANSWER: I don't agree, and think 5 Nc3 is just as good as 5 d4. We
look at this move in Game 7. --- QUESTION: Why create a gaping hole on e4? ---
ANSWER: We give up something to get something. While it's true that we hand
Black control over the e4-square, we seize a good chunk of central control
with our d-pawn. French Defence players commonly allow such structures with
even material. In this instance, we assume the French Defence posture (in
reverse) with an extra pawn.} ({We now look at two other options first: I used

"Your screams will provide me hours of entertainment, which is wonderful since
I am easily bored," the knight declares to White's king, who can only suppress
a yawn at the knight's bluster. When in doubt, we tend to agonize between
taking radical action and its opposing power, doing nothing. How one
interprets such positions varies with a degree of latitude. This is Black's
main move, intending dirty tricks like ...Nxh2, which is very tempting since
White doesn't have the power to play h2-h3. However, White has adequate
resources to deal with it since he has access to Ne4! ideas.} ({Black is by no

problem with this eyesore of a structure - not to mention White's ominous lag
in development? --- ANSWER: I begin with the rather outrageous supposition
that White stands better. Admittedly, terrible sights swim before the white
king's eyes, and the structure may make for an ugly sight. However, White is
up two pawns and the onus is on Black to prove compensation. Also, I just

{If you play the Reversed Leningrad Dutch set-ups, then the following two
diagrams will be your most common tabiya set-ups. We reach highly specialized
positions, where matters are not likely to arrange themselves in conjunction
with our opponent's opening-theory wishes. With our last move, Qe1, the
argument for rights to the e4-square continues afresh. Our queen's seemingly
innocuous errand, when examined deeper, holds dangerous portent for Black.} 1.
-- {In the position:} (1. -- {1. We do our best to force our opponent to
rethink and revise views by taking him or her on with our thematic e4-break.})
(1. -- {2. Our queen raises a pointed finger warningly in the black king's
direction, perhaps later playing h2-h3, g3-g4 and Qh4.}) (1. -- {3. After we
play Qe1, Black usually ignores our impending e4 break and castles, a move
based on the philosophy: If we are unable to contribute meaningfully to the
conversation, then our best course is to remain silent on the matter. Black
will subsequently respond to e2-e4 with ...dxe4, followed by the central
counter ...e7-e5, after which we usually take on the hanging pawns, with
superior central control and kingside attacking chances, but also perhaps a
liability should we reach an ending.}) *

1. f4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. g3 {In this chapter, we examine Leningrad Dutch/Bird
positions.} g6 4. Bg2 Bg7 5. d3 d5 6. O-O e6 {With such fluid structures, the
positions tend to be murky beyond enumeration. Black reinforces the d5-pawn
and plans to develop his g8-knight to e7. We will see more of this black
structure in Chapter 6 (Bird's versus the Reversed English) later in the book 
(except with Black's d-pawn on d6, rather than on d5). For the remainder of
the chapter, we mainly look at positions where Black's knight develops to f6.
--- QUESTION: What is the purpose of developing the knight to e7, as opposed
to f6? --- ANSWER: By developing the knight to e7, Black keeps his kingside
pawns fluid. --- QUESTION: Why does such fluidity matter? --- ANSWER: White
often later attacks Black's king with a kingside pawn avalanche, beginning
with e2-e4 and g2-g4. Black plans to meet this idea by erecting a wall with ...f7-f5 at an appropriate moment, to keep White's kingside ambitions in check.}
7. c3 {A useful, multipurpose move: 1. It blunts the power of the g7-bishop,
guarding the b2-pawn in case of ...Qb6 tricks. --- 2. Black's pieces are kept
out of d4.} ({Since our plan is Qe1 for the remainder of the chapter, just for
the sake of consistency, you may want to play this way against every Black
system. For example, after} 7. Qe1 Nge7 8. c3 b6 9. Na3 Bb7 10. h3 a6 11. Nc2
b5 12. e4 {(White engages in his thematic central pawn break)} dxe4 $6 {(I
think Black is better off avoiding this move, since it hands White the
e4-square after e5)} 13. dxe4 c4 14. Be3 O-O 15. Bc5 {, White has a pleasant
grip on the dark squares, F.Grafl-J.De Wiljes, Internet (blitz) 2007.}) 7...
Nge7 8. e4 {This is White's main break in the Leningrad Dutch/Bird. White
takes advantage of the fact that Black's knight isn't developed on f6 (thus it
does not fight for control of the e4-square).} O-O ({QUESTION: Can Black
equalize by swapping queens with} 8... dxe4 9. dxe4 Qxd1 10. Rxd1 e5 {- ? ---
White may soon get hanging central pawns, and with queens off, won't they
become weak? --- ANSWER: I think White's central pawns - hanging or not - are
well protected, and the ending favours White due to his extra central space.
For example:} 11. Na3 O-O 12. Nb5 Bg4 (12... b6 13. Be3 exf4 14. gxf4 Bg4 15.

Nxe3 23. Kxe3 {when Black finds himself down a pawn.}) 9. Na3 {In this case,
the a3-square may be the best spot for the knight, since it may be useful
later on in building White's space advantage with a future plan of e4-e5,
d3-d4, and Nc2, which supports the d4-pawn. The knight may also later transfer
to the e3-square for a kingside assault.} b6 10. e5 ({White can also retain
central tension with} 10. Qe2 {but it doesn't seem to make much difference
since Black can force e4-e5 with} Ba6 {(threat: ...dxe4, when the d3-pawn then
hangs)} 11. e5 Qd7 12. Bd2 b5 $5 13. d4 cxd4 14. cxd4 Qb7 {(threat: ...b4,
which forces White's next move)} 15. b4 $1 Qb6 16. Nc2 {(as pointed out

he may claim a tiny edge. He was later able to whip up a decisive kingside
assault by exposing Black's king with g3-g4, K.Movsziszian-S.Das, Barcelona
2014.}) 10... Ba6 11. Nc2 Qd7 12. Re1 {QUESTION: Why move off the f-file?
Isn't White attempting a g3-g4 and f4-f5 pawn break? --- ANSWER: White's last
move was prophylactic, discouraging ...f7-f6, when White responds with exf6,
handing Black a hole on e5 and a backward e6-pawn.} Rac8 ({After} 12... d4 {,
since White plans an eventual kingside assault, his best bet is to always try
and keep the centre as closed as possible with} 13. c4 {(this move also denies
Black's knight use of the d5-square). Following} Bb7 14. Ng5 $1 {(heading for
the e4-square)} f6 {(otherwise Black may never get a chance at the freeing
move)} 15. exf6 Rxf6 16. Qe2 Re8 17. Nxe6 $1 {(White isn't intimidated by the
coming pin on the e-file)} Nf5 $2 18. Bd5 Re7 ({I think Black saw too late that
} 18... Kh8 {would be met with the decisive shot} 19. Nxc5 $1 Rxe2 20. Nxd7 {
when} Rxc2 {would run into the crushing} 21. Re8+) 19. Nxc5+ Qxd5 20. cxd5 Rxe2
21. Rxe2 bxc5 22. dxc6 Rxc6 23. b3 {, Black is down an exchange and a pawn, G.Cabrilo-N.Nikcevic, Niksic 1991.}) 13. g4 f6 {Principle: Counter in the centre
when assaulted on the wing. Black must play this move sooner or later, or risk
White building his attack in leisure.} 14. exf6 Bxf6 15. d4 {Clamping down on
both the e5-hole and the backward e6-pawn.} Rce8 16. Be3 {Threatening the
c5-pawn.} Qd6 17. Qd2 Na5 18. b3 {White must slightly weaken his queenside to
cover the strategic threat ...Nc4.} Nb7 {Perhaps intending to transfer to the
knight to the e4-square in the future with an eventual ...Nd6 and ...Ne4.} 19.
Bf2 {Heading for the g3-square to harass Black's queen and cover the f4-pawn.
This move also uncovers the e-file to further pressure the weak e6-pawn.} Nc6
20. Bg3 Qd8 21. Ne5 {QUESTION: By allowing Black ...Nxe5, doesn't White shut
down his own pressure on the e5-square and the e6-pawn? --- ANSWER: He does,
but gets the following compensation in return. After recapturing on e5: 1.
Black's knight is denied its planned ...Nd6 idea. --- 2. White gains central
space, cramping Black further. --- 3. White creates a kingside pawn majority,
which automatically enhances kingside attacking chances.} Nxe5 $6 {This may be
too obliging and now follows a strategic rock slide.} ({Perhaps Black should
have considered retaining tension with} 21... Nba5 {when White's edge was
smaller than the one he got in the game.}) 22. dxe5 $1 {As mentioned above,
the kingside pawn majority automatically amplifies White's kingside attacking
chances.} Be7 {EXERCISE (planning): This must have been a moment of terrified
apprehension for Black, similar to what I experienced upon spotting my wife
Nancy surreptitiously blending kale into my morning smoothie. We have opposite
wing majorities. White's only plan is to try and whip up a kingside attack.
Come up with a clear plan. --- ANSWER: Play g4-g5!, intending the manoeuvre
Ne3, Ng4 and Nf6+. This will play create havoc with Black's king safety.} 23.
g5 $1 Qd7 24. Ne3 {The knight spots an opening in the defence and glides
through.} Rd8 25. Ng4 {Mission accomplished. Black is in dire trouble. He must
watch out for both Nf6+ and even Nh6+ in some cases.} d4 {This is a frantic
attempt to generate counterplay in the middle, since Black sees Nf6+ falling
upon him with tremendous force.} 26. Rad1 Na5 27. h4 $5 {Principle: The threat
is stronger than its execution.} ({White wants to leave Nf6+ hovering over
Black's head, thinking about h4-h5, rather than jump in with the immediate} 27.
Nf6+ {which is also strong as} Bxf6 28. exf6 Nc6 29. Bf2 {gives White a clear
strategic advantage.}) 27... Bb7 28. h5 Bxg2 29. Qxg2 gxh5 30. Nh6+ $5 {
Sometimes our idiosyncrasies are a blessing, and other times a curse. For some
players, the only certainty is their unpredictability. The knight bursts forth
with perhaps a tad too much exuberance, sneering at the f6-offer in
disparagement.} ({This idea, which contradicts the conventional wisdom of such
positions, may be too ornate and throws away some of the advantage, which is
there for the taking with} 30. Nf6+ $1 {. "Were it not deeply disrespectful,
one might call Your Grace a snivelling coward," declares the knight with a
condescending smile to Black's king, who is caught hiding under his bed, his
teeth chattering like castanets. Following} Bxf6 31. exf6 Nc6 32. c4 Rf7 33.
Kh2 Re8 {, White can leisurely build up a kingside attack, coupled with
pressure on the e6-pawn.}) 30... Kh8 31. Qh3 {Internally, the queen convulses
with mirth at the thought of the black king's distress.} Nc6 32. Qxh5 {Threat:
Nf7+ and Nxd8.} Qe8 $1 {Black stands slightly worse in the ending, which is
infinitely better than getting mated in the middlegame!} 33. Qxe8 {"How very
tiresome when a bumbling halfwit dares enter our august presence," mutters the
queen to herself, as she submits to her annoying e8-sister's wishes. Black's
troubles, however, don't entirely disappear with the swap of queens.} Rdxe8 34.
c4 {White cuts out ...dxc3 ideas. Advantage to White: 1. He still owns
considerably more space. --- 2. He can move his king all the way to e4. --- 3.
He still has attacking prospects along the h-file. --- 4. He can backtrack
with Ng4 and Nf6, causing disharmony in Black's camp. --- 5. He can play for
an eventual f5-break.} Rd8 35. Kg2 Nb4 36. Rd2 a6 {Black needs a queenside
distraction and prepares ...b5, but it is slow. Maybe he should get his king
into the game, preparing his eventual transfer to g6.} 37. Ng4 $1 {It's never
too late to say you are sorry. White realizes the h6-adventure yielded him
little and decides to reroute the knight to a superior square.} b5 {Possibly
mistimed.} ({Black should perhaps sacrifice a pawn with} 37... h5 $5 {as
sometimes our best strategy is unreasonable petulance. After} 38. Rh1 Kg7 39.
Rxh5 Rh8 40. Rh6 Rxh6 41. gxh6+ Kg6 42. Kf3 {, conversion won't be so easy for
White.}) 38. Rh1 {Threatening Rh6 with a simple pile-up on the h7-pawn. Both
the e6- and h7-weaknesses continue to remain under the rook's not-so-benign
surveillance.} Rd7 {When our need is desperate, so are our actions. The power
of attrition takes its toll on Black, since he allows e6 to fall. This gives
White two connected passers on the e and f-files.} ({Also futile is} 38... Rde8
39. Rh6 Bd8 {(Black's pieces nurse e6, as if consoling a sick, beloved pet)}
40. Nf6 Bxf6 41. exf6 bxc4 42. bxc4 Rf7 43. Kf3 Nc6 44. Bh4 $1 {(threat: g6!)}
Rg8 45. Rh2 d3 46. Ke4 Nd4 47. Be1 $1 {(intending to transfer to c3)} Nf5 48.
R6h3 Rd7 49. Bc3 {and Black can resign.}) 39. Rh6 bxc4 40. bxc4 d3 41. Rxe6 {
Black's counterplay income fails to meet cash outflow and White's play comes
faster.} Nc2 42. Rxa6 {Black continues to give with open-hearted bounty. What
he receives in return (besides the pure altruistic joy of giving) however, is
questionable.} Rd4 43. Kh3 Bd8 44. Rd6 $1 {Picking off Black's last hope, the
d3-pawn.} Ba5 45. Rxd3 Rxc4 46. Rd7 {. Haunted eyes take inventory of the
ruins of his position. Nf6 follows, leaving Black without hope. --- SUMMARY:
We all carry theoretical knowledge within our memory banks which doesn't do us
any good in real life. For example, I remember from high school chemistry
class that hydrogen's atomic number is one, while uranium's is 92. Besides
writing this thought in this book, I doubt that I will derive much future
benefit from this knowledge. We chess players are the world champions of
carrying around useless knowledge which won't help us in real life. However,
one piece of knowledge which will win you games is the plan White played in
this game: Remember this important Leningrad/Bird attacking theme: f2-f4,
e4-e5 and g3-g4-g5. Then transfer a knight to the f6-square, via g4, with
serious attacking chances.} 1-0

Leningrad Dutch, and is the one we concentrate on in the chapter. --- QUESTION:
What are the ideas behind 7 Qe1 - ? --- ANSWER: White's main point is to play
for the e4-break. A secondary idea can be for the queen to swing into the
attack via h4, after the insertion of h2-h3 and g3-g4.} Qb6 $5 {My opponent
seeks to throw me off theory with a rare move. Black pressures the b2-pawn,
while leaving open possibilities of ...c4+. In the following games, we look at
Black's more common responses 7...Nc6 and 7...d4. --- Here, I would like to

variation).} 8. Nc3 {This is already a new move in the position. --- QUESTION:
Doesn't a coming ...d5-d4, gaining a tempo on your knight, bother you? ---
ANSWER: Well, it did bother me a little but I didn't see an alternative I
liked. In any case, allowing the d-pawn advance is pretty typical in the
Leningrad Dutch after 1 d4 f5 2 Nf3 Nf6 3 g3 g6 4 Bg2 Bg7 5 0-0 0-0 6 c4 d6 7

especially when Black has played an early ...Qb6 instead of ...Nc6.}) 9... Nc6
10. e4 {The point is if Black captures the e3-pawn en-passant, as he did in
the game, then White's knight emerges with tempo after Nxe3 and Nc4.} dxe3 {
QUESTION: This move seems to activate White's pieces. Why not just leave it
alone and attack the queenside? --- ANSWER: I think then White gets a slightly
favourable version of a reversed g3 King's Indian, where the centre is closed.
White can attack kingside very quickly with h2-h3, g3-g4 and Qh4. Also,
Black's queen on b6 actually hinders his natural queenside attack, blocking
the natural ...b7-b5 and ...c5-c4 break.} 11. Nxe3 Nd4 12. Ne5 {This way White
gains yet another tempo with a coming c2-c3. Of course pushing the c-pawn
doesn't come without cost, since my d3-pawn becomes a backward one. But this
is a normal state of events in many Leningrad Dutch positions.} Be6 13. c3 {
This has to be played sooner or later. The d4-knight gets kicked out, at the
cost of weakening the d3-pawn.} Nf5 14. Qf2 {Taking aim at the c5-pawn if
Black trades on e3.} Rac8 15. N3c4 Qc7 16. a4 {Anchoring the c4-knight without
having to worry about ...b7-b5.} Bd5 17. Bh3 $5 {Generally, an exchange of
light-squared bishops tends to suck some of the inherent dynamism out of
White's position. Now White toys with the g3-g4 push.} e6 18. g4 {Out you go!
I realized this move weakens, but it's thematic. --- QUESTION: Where are you
going with this pawn push? --- ANSWER: I hadn't yet outlined a clear plan. I
just knew that White should seek to create a disturbance around Black's king.
I can play for either f4-f5 or g4-g5 tricks. Also by playing g3-g4, it clears
the h4-square for my queen.} Nd6 {Challenging my c4-outpost.} 19. Ne3 {Played
with a hidden threat.} c4 $6 {EXERCISE (combination alert): When equally
powerful forces are in stasis, all hell breaks loose if a third factor is
introduced by one side. All our troubles over the board are those of our own
creation. Black's overconfident last move is a mistake. My opponent either
missed or ignored White's threat. How can White win material?} ({It was
necessary for Black to hand over the bishop pair with} 19... Bc6 20. Nxc6 Qxc6
21. Bg2 Qc7 {when Black's position was still fine since the d3-pawn remained
weak.}) 20. g5 $1 {ANSWER: Removal of the guard. When Black's f6-knight moves,
White captures on d5, then Black hangs an exchange on c8. --- I entered this
line with great hesitation, since I knew winning the exchange wasn't
completely consequence-free. Nevertheless, it was the correct decision.} Nfe8

uncertainty. I suspected that my opponent was in shock, having missed the
tactical idea.} ({I expected} 20... Nh5 $1 21. Nxd5 exd5 22. Bxc8 Rxc8 {. ---
QUESTION: Doesn't Black have full compensation for the exchange here? After
all, White looks overextended on the kingside and is weak on the light squares.

full compensation for the exchange - for the strategic troubles you pointed

my king for now looks reasonably well guarded.}) 21. Nxd5 exd5 22. Nd7 {The
human move. This way I don't hand over the light-squared bishop, the steward
of the white squares.} ({Houdini prefers} 22. Bxc8 Nxc8 23. dxc4 dxc4 24. Re1 {

wilfully refuse to take action is, in a strange way, an action in itself.} ({
I wanted to develop but my advantage drops considerably after the text move, a
poor replica of what I could get after the counterintuitive} 24. Qxa7 $1 {, a

looks like an overreaction.} Qe7 28. Bxd8 Qxd8 29. Qxd3 {Okay, so although in
serious time pressure, I'm up two exchanges and conversion should be simple,

tend to hold theories by the dozen, but very few actual facts. Of course,
White is unable to capture the 'hanging' queen on f2 due to a mega-fork. So,
our decision is between 33 Bg2 and 33 Qxd5. One wins, while the other allows

{GM Vladimir Malaniuk is one of the best Leningrad Dutch players with the
Black pieces (as prep for this book, I went over his black Dutch games), so
it's natural that he sometimes opens with 1 f4! to reach his favourite lines a
move up.} 1. f4 Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 O-O 5. O-O c5 6. d3 d5 7. Qe1
Nc6 {Black continues to develop and allow White the e4-break.} ({In Game 15,
we will look at} 7... d4 {.}) 8. c3 {White's main move. --- QUESTION: Why play
8 c3 - ? --- ANSWER: For the following reasons: 1. White seizes control over
both d4- and b4-squares and thus rules out any White knight forays on those
squares. --- 2. White holds his structure fluid, keeping his opponent guessing.
For example, White can play for the simple e4, or he can play future ideas
like Na3-c2, Bd2, Rb1 and b2-b4. --- Note that in the Dutch Leningrad, one
standard Black line goes 1 d4 f5 2 g3 Nf6 3 Bg2 g6 4 Nf3 Bg7 5 0-0 0-0 6 c4 d6
7 Nc3 c6. Here, one of the motifs of 7...c6 is to play on the queenside with ...Qa5. However in our line, our queen is slated for central or kingside play
with Qe1 so that option is not available.} ({QUESTION: Why doesn't White play} 
8. e4 {if this is our main idea in the Qe1 line? --- ANSWER: There is no real
rush. White doesn't mind transposing to ...d4 lines if Black opts for} d4 9.
Na3 Nd5 10. Bd2 {, which is a position we examine in Game 15 and Game 16. In
this chapter, we will concentrate on the more direct 8 e4.}) 8... Qd6 {Black
fights for control of the e5-square and seeks to play ...e5 at some point
himself. --- QUESTION: This straightforward plan looks logical. Is there a
downside? --- ANSWER: There are two issues Black must deal with: 1. Black's
queen sits in the path of a potential pawn fork after White plays e4,
threatening e4-e5. --- 2. Black's queen may later be vulnerable to either Nc4,
or even Ne4, if Black's d-pawn is exchanged for White's e-pawn.} 9. Na3 {
QUESTION: Why play the knight to the rim? Isn't it better to let it remain
centralized on the d2-square? --- ANSWER: All five games from my database had
White playing Na3, which has two points: 1. Any ...d4 ideas can be met with
the tempo-gaining Nc4. --- 2. Playing the knight to the d2-square weakens
White's most tender point in the Bird/Leningrad Dutch: the d3-square/pawn.} ({
QUESTION: What is wrong with the immediate} 9. e4 {- ? --- ANSWER: This is a
new move in the position and actually Houdini's first choice. There is
probably nothing wrong with it. I think White simply wants to keep Black
guessing by posting the knight to a3. Black can respond with} dxe4 10. dxe4 e5

is one problem with tossing in c2-c3 and then e2-e4: the d3-square is weakened)

19. Qxc5 b6 20. Qe3 Ba6 21. Rfd1 Rac8 22. Rac1 {and White has won a pawn. ---
However, his e-pawn is isolated. Also, Black's position is weakness-free and
he has super-active pieces. I would say Black comes close to full compensation
here, but if given a choice, I would still take the pawn-up side.}) 9... Bg4 {
This move in the position is a very common idea against the Bird's in other
lines. Black plays an early ...Bg4 and ...Bxf3 to enforce a quick ...e7-e5
break. Of course, Black's freedom comes with consequences, as he or she hands
us the bishop pair in the process.} ({A look at other options: With} 9... Bf5 {
, Black clamps down on White's e4-break. I don't think this plan is such a
great idea, since Black ends up wasting time with the bishop if White manages

implication: I plan to confuse my way to victory against my higher rated
opponent. --- ANSWER: When hoping to complicate, we sometimes play like a

to earn a '+=' with White. Instead, play into a position you feel you

QUESTION: Why does Black want to play ...e7-e5, swapping a central pawn for a
wing pawn? It clearly isn't a freeing break, since Black's pieces are already

valuable e-pawn for White's f-pawn, which also opens the f-file for White. In
return, Black creates a backward pawn target on e2, which he hopes to
pressurize later down the e-file. --- QUESTION: Who do you think gets the
better of the bargain? --- ANSWER: I prefer White's chances, while the comps

QUESTION: Why hold back and play the c-pawn up one notch, rather than to the
c5-square? --- ANSWER: Black deals with the Bird/Leningrad Dutch by setting up
with an ultra-solid Schlecter Slav formation with the following reasons: 1.
The d5-pawn is reinforced. --- 2. Black's queen has access to the b6-square,
so White must watch out for ...Qb6, followed by ...Ng4 trick. This motif
simultaneously threatens the b2-pawn as well as the e3- and f2-squares.} 7. e3
{White's most flexible move.} ({QUESTION: Why this move rather than our normal
} 7. Qe1 {- ? --- ANSWER: For two reasons: 1. 7 e3 may be slightly more

QUESTION: Then why do so many players choose 3 e3 over the immediate 3 e4 - ?
--- ANSWER: We mustn't overlook an extra dimensional factor in White's
equation: flexibility. White's formation is fluid, and by playing the e-pawn
modestly to the e3-square, we keep Black guessing as to our intent. It's based
on the philosophy: It becomes difficult for our opponents to overcome an
anonymous enemy, since they don't know which direction to shoot. Also, the
White player might be a Classical Dutch or Stonewall Dutch specialist, seeking
to embroil his opponent into a tabiya where he is more experienced with,

and even Bd1. --- 2. White can play for a kingside attack, with Qe1 and Qh4,

queenside plan: a4, Na3, c2-c3, Nc2, Bd2, Rb1 and b2-b4, which we look at
later in the chapter. --- 4. I have even seen White switch later on to a
delayed Stonewall set-up with c2-c3 and d3-d4, if Black posts his or her pieces
oddly, or out of sync with this formation. --- Now saying all this, I don't
play the Classical lines. --- QUESTION: Why not? --- ANSWER: They just feel

White's main move in the position, but it may not be best. IM Tim Taylor calls
this popular idea "primitive and direct" and then later refers to it as a
"crude attacking move which, being so obvious, is easy to defend against". ---
QUESTION: Do you agree with Taylor's assessment? --- ANSWER: Pretty much, yes!
However, I will add that "primitive and direct" ideas may sometimes constitute
a virtue on a club level of play, or in rapid games, where defence is much
harder than attack, due to the time shortage. So I wouldn't dismiss it out of
hand. Later on in the chapter, we see GM Lie play the Qh4 idea and win, but a
move later, only after Black's queen plays to c7. --- QUESTION: What
difference does that make? --- ANSWER: When Black's queen sits on d8 and White
plays Qh4, then Black has access to ...e7-e5! ideas which both counter in the
centre and also offer to swap queens, which White obviously doesn't want,
since he launched an attack with Qh4.} b6 {Black calmly completes his

uneasy feeling that his idea appears to be built more by emotion than
intellect. Houdini gives Black a slight plus, since White experiences

Leningrad and Stonewall Bird set-ups). By playing our knight to e5, we clear
the way for Bf3, perhaps following with d3 and e4 if allowed. After} Qc7 {

{With the Bird Stonewall formation, we clamp down on Black's natural ...e7-e5
break, with an inverted pyramidal wall on f4, e3 and d4. In doing so, the
polarity of the two sides' goals grow even more pronounced. The d4-f4 clamp
does indeed produce a stifling quality, effectively hindering ...e7-e5, but it
doesn't come without cost, and the implications of our act are far-reaching,
since we voluntarily allow Black a juicy e4-hole. Medical science sometimes
utilizes snake toxins as a necessary ingredient in a pharmaceutical line. The
moral: even a dangerous and toxic entity may have its beneficial side-effects.
With this structure, we gamble that our e5-clamp and enhanced kingside
attacking chances make up for our voluntary e4-puncture. "What kingside
attack?" you may ask.} 1. -- {Well, for now it runs only with apathetic
efficiency. But in the future, we may be able to generate a serious build-up,
extending our kingside boundaries by force of arms, with a set-up like 0-0,
Qe1, Nbd2, fianchetto our bad c1-bishop, then proceed with Ne5, Qh4, Rf3,
g2-g4, Rh3 and Raf1, when virtually every white piece participates in the
assault. Of course, we must be careful. When a Stonewall structure sours, our
former attacks become like bad vacations: we are full of joy when embarking,
yet at the end, ask ourselves why we bothered with the time and expense. So
take a look at the games in this chapter and see if this risky structure
appeals to you.} *

SUMMARY: In my opinion, the queenside fianchetto plan is White's most
promising attempt to extract an edge in the Reversed Stonewall lines as: 1.
The plan is quicker than the cumbersome plan of transferring White's bishop to
h4. --- 2. The plan is more flexible. It doesn't commit White to a kingside
assault, and we can play in the centre with an eventual c4-break. --- 3. Any

1. f4 {QUESTION: In all cases in this chapter, we only looked at the Stonewall
line when Black played ...d5. Is a Stonewall viable when Black's structure is
unfixed and flexible?} ({ANSWER: The Stonewall is still viable when Black's
structure remains fluid, but it's a bit trickier for our side, because we keep
guessing just if and when Black will engage a central pawn break. For example:

queenside.} 4. d4 {Our founding father played both b3-versions and the

within the pawn chain.} 5. Bd3 ({I would prefer} 5. b3 {before flicking in Bd3.
}) 5... Nf6 ({QUESTION: Should Black gain the tempo with} 5... c4 {- ? ---
ANSWER: That's a tough call. On the one hand, ...c5-c4 violates the principle
of keeping the centre fluid, in case White later builds up an attack. On the
other hand, the move gains a tempo. I would probably play ...c5-c4 in this

lashed out by a raging blind man, unable to hit his enemy. Ah yes, the good
old Romantic era folk. Henry Bird has the dubious distinction of having a
minus score with his own opening (47%), and maybe the reason was due to this
sort of moves! Of course, the other reason is that Bird mainly played in a
stratified zone against the elite players of his day, and may still have
scored below 50% had he tried other openings instead. --- QUESTION: What is
his last move all about? --- ANSWER: The mind of the 19th century chess master
was a huffy entity, always trying to pick a fight. Obviously, White has better
than this time-wasting idea.} ({It would be wiser to keep ambitions on leash

the f5-square and perhaps menacing ...Bb5.} 13. Qe2 {Preventing ...Bb5.} O-O-O
$6 {QUESTION: Isn't Black's king more exposed on the queenside than the
kingside? --- ANSWER: Black takes on an impossible task, the way a baseball
outfielder tries to run down a ball which we, the spectators, can clearly see
is way, way of out of mortal reach. Yes, this appears to be one of those
"let's-tempt-fate" reactions. The decision may stem from the 19th century code

factor in that Black also gets 'more' development). Our pawn grab (think of it

..e5!? is probably sound. I suggest we practice the acceptance lines against
our computers, since we must be supremely prepared if we eat the pawn and hope
to survive Black's coming initiative. With the pawn grab, we edge forward to
the lip of destruction, yet (hopefully!) refuse to jump. If your cardiologist
bans you from this pawn grab line, then you can play 6 d4, with an even
Stonewall structure, or even dodge the entire line with 3 d4. Also, the
improvement 8 Qf3! allows White a superior version of the pawn grab line than
what Kramnik got in the game.} 1-0

distance from fruition. --- QUESTION: Isn't White violating the principles:
Don't open the game or create confrontation while lagging in development? ---
ANSWER: Greys are so much more confusing than Black or White. Correct, yet
Danielsen realizes the position is an anomaly. Black has no good way to
exploit his development lead, since he can only open one file without any
meaningful effect on White's position, since he lacks entry points. Meanwhile:
1. White continues to annex territory at a rate which would warm the heart of
dictators worldwide. --- 2. White's bishops awaken with the coming of the
e2-e4 advance.} dxe4 10. dxe4 e5 $5 {I wouldn't have played this move. This is
simply the exchange of one strategic disability for another. GM Luther decides
he must challenge White's gigantic centre with a stake of his own, but in
doing so, he weakens his light squares. When we desperately search for
counterplay when none exists, we become like homeless people, sifting and
rummaging through a dumpster, seeking an item of value in a trash heap.

forces on the kingside had been one of courteous disinterest. The implication
of such a provocative act is far reaching, since the position loses its

last move introduces a hybrid line, similar to Closed Sicilian, dubbed 'The
Clamp'. --- QUESTION: What is White's idea behind 8 c3 - ? --- ANSWER: Very
simply, White plays a big centre with d3-d4 at some stage and attempts to
squeeze Black out.} ({QUESTION: Are we going to look at transposition to
Closed Sicilian with} 8. Nc3 {- ? --- ANSWER: Yes, in fact, we cover it in the
following two games, but only when Black plays an early ...Nf6 (which I
believe is White's most promising Closed Sicilian variant). On early ...e7-e6
and ...e7-e5 lines, which we will look at later in the chapter, we proceed in
non-Closed Sicilian fashion with the Clamp system.}) 8... Rb8 {Black's main

final chapter. In this one, we only cover the Reversed Leningrad, since I just
don't have room in the book to cover all three. Tim Taylor covered the
Classical versus the Reversed English in his Bird's opening book, and I

{QUESTION: Where is Black going with this knight? --- ANSWER: In these

removes a defender from Black's king.} 11. d4 {The Clamp arises. Korchnoi

Early ...Bg4 and ...Bxf3 themes are common in the Closed Sicilian (and also
the Clamp System lines). Black sometimes considers it a reasonable trade-off,
since he or she is willing to concede the bishop pair to reduce White's
kingside attacking force and weaken control over the contested d4-square. ---

Rb8 9. h3 {I think this is White's best move in the position. --- QUESTION:
What is the move's purpose? --- ANSWER: It's threefold: 1. White can post his
bishop on e3, without fear of ...Ng4. --- 2. White prevents the option ...Bg4
and ...Bxf3, a swap which reduces White's kingside attacking fuel and weakens
the d4-square. --- 3. White can expand later on the kingside with g3-g4 and
f4-f5, with an attacking plan common to both Closed Sicilian and Sicilian
Grand Prix, which goes Qe1-h4, Bh6 and Ng5, loading up on Black's often
under-defended king in this line.} ({A rather direct way of handling the

{Black gains valuable queenside ground.} 10. a3 {QUESTION: This move induces a
future swap on b4, which opens the queenside further. Is this wise on White's

our general policy should be one of wary non-intervention, whenever possible.
This position is an exception to the general rule. When White avoids the swap
of a-pawns he is in danger of a queenside collapse, as in Spassky's game

remember Bruce asking me before the game, what opening should he should play

a tactician may have no qualms in giving away pawns to attack, while a pure

Such positions allow for elasticity of interpretation. There isn't a single

QUESTION: Is Black not chasing a chimera with this decision? --- ANSWER:
Black's aggressive antecedent (his decision to give up his light-squared
bishop for White's knight) justifies - at least in his mind - this speculative
venture. When set into motion, such high-risk plans are mindless mechanisms,
with no off-switch. The concept of 'importance' isn't necessarily a mutually
agreed upon subject. In the chess world, there is a percentage of players
among us with a certain birth defect, in that they have enlarged lobes in the
brain-area which control risk-taking. Khalifman, like Topalov and Tal, can
safely be placed in this category. Khalifman feels a solution which is sensed,
more than grasped by the analytical mind. So he attempts an enterprising/foolhardy decision, which places positional considerations above material
disadvantage. Darwin theorized that population was dependent upon food supply.
If food dwindles, then so does population. Khalifman feels his counterplay
level (his food supply) is low, so he hands over his queen for only rook and
bishop, eliminating White's light square power, while taking control over the
c-file. The idea does force White on the defensive, but only temporarily. The
trouble is White can defend his queenside, while gradually preparing h2-h3 and
g3-g4, and go after Black's king.} ({QUESTION: White seems to hold all the
strategic trumps after} 25... Rc6 26. Rac1 {. What do you suggest for Black to
counter this situation? --- ANSWER: Black can speculate with an exchange offer
for the light squares and a passed pawn with} Rc4 $5 {. This sacrificial plan

thankless task to try and balance that which is basically an irreconcilable
relationship between Black's desire to counterattack, and the actual reality,
which says a counterattack won't work when lagging in development. Be heavily
prepared for this one, since at some point, one or more of your future
