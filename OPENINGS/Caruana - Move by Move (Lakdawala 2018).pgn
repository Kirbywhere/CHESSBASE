Already a very strong grandmaster, he announced hispresence as a leading contender for the world title in 2014 when he scored anincredible 8½/10 (including seven straight wins from the first seven games)in the Sinquefield Cup in St Louis. This was an elite event where he finishedan astonishing three points clear of Magnus Carlsen, whom he will challengefor the world title in late 2018. Caruana earned this right thanks to his finevictory in the Berlin Candidates where he scored 9/13 and finished a pointclear of a world class field. --- Caruana's style is universal. He is a verydangerous attacking player who is also equally at home in quiet strategicpositions or manoeuvring in an endgame. In this respect he is the epitome ofthe modern grandmaster, being a hard-working and determined fighter whoprepares thoroughly and plays with great determination and accuracy.} 1.

In doing so,I ignored my mother's pleadings to "Go outside and play with your friends;climb a tree." Now there is a new generation of kids who don't want to gooutside and prefer the study of chess. Nostalgia is an alluring force whichtricks us into thinking that everything in the past was better than everythingis in the present. When we study the games of past great players and try toimitate them, are we not echoes of the real thing? --- The games of the greatplayers of the present generation are equally inspiring. American/ItalianGrandmaster Fabio Caruana, today perhaps the hardest working top grandmasterin the world, was, I suspect, just such a child who wouldn't go outside toplay, preferring to study chess. He was born in Miami, Florida, on July 30,1992. At the age of four, his family moved to Bobby Fischer's home town ofBrooklyn, New York. At age five, he learned how to play chess, an event thatradically altered his own life and the life of his parents, Lou and SantinaCaruana, who recognized in their son a person gifted extraordinary abilitiesand whose future brimmed with inexpressible possibilities.} 1. Z0 {His firstcoach was NM Bruce Pandolfini and then he switched to grandmaster Miron Sherfrom the age of 8 to 12. There is no such thing as dynastic succession orinheritance in chess. Otherwise we would be awaiting a World Championshipmatch featuring the great grandchildren of Alekhine and Capablanca. Yet veryfew players who got a shot at a title match can claim sole responsibility fortheir success. Their parents and coaches get at least a chunk of the credit.Fabiano's parents are people who went well past what we consider parentalresponsibility for their child. They literally gave up on their own lives tomake Fabiano's a success. At the age of 12, his parents made a decision thatthey would, as a family, work to devote their lives to the nurturing ofFabiano's chess ability. They haven't done such a bad job raising him either,since every time I hear Fabiano speak in an online video he radiates sincerehumility, which, as we all understand, is an uncommon trait for a geniusliving in a world of giant egos. That which appears exceptional to one personmay appear completely ordinary to another. What strikes me about Caruana -even more than his astounding chess ability - is his humility, as if he werethe guy next door and nothing special. If he wins the upcoming WorldChampionship match against Carlsen, he will create history by being an egolessworld chess champion, the rarest of combinations. --- They then moved toMadrid to study with IM Boris Zlotnik. In 2007, they moved to Budapest to workwith grandmaster Alex Chernin and, in 2010, moved yet again to Lugano,Switzerland, to work with grandmaster Vladimir Chuchelov. Fabiano's successesbegan to mount. In 2007, at age 14, he surpassed Hikaru Nakamura's record tobecome the youngest ever U.S. Grandmaster. From the viewpoint of Italy,Caruana was now their greatest son since Gioachino Greco dominated the chessscene in the early 17th Century. Caru won the elite Dortmund tournament in2012, 2014 and 2015. --- However, it was really in 2014 when the chess worldbegan to see Caruana as a potential challenger who had the potential todethrone the all-but-invincible World Champion, Magnus Carlsen. In the 2014Sinquefield Cup in St. Louis Caruana won his first two games and then in roundthree defeated Magnus with Black. Caruana went on to do the impossible bynotching up seven wins in a row, all against top ten players in the world. Hewon the tournament by a mile, with three rounds to spare. His performancerating was a typo-like 3103, a number we as chess players are just not used toseeing. Caru's 7-0 start rivals Fischer's incredible 6-0, 6-0 sweeps ofTaimanov and Larsen in their Candidates' matches in the early 1970s.} (1. Z0 {In 2016, Fabiano was on board one for the gold medal winning U.S. Olympiadteam. In the same year, he won the U.S. Championship by a full point and thencame the World Championship Candidates' tournament. The Candidates is an eventwhere a single player is given the opportunity to show that he is better thanthe rest, who are merely pretenders to the throne. It looked as if Caruana hada chance to become Carlsen's next challenger, only for the opportunity to betaken from him at the last minute through a tragic final round loss toKarjakin, who became the challenger. --- 2018 was Caruana's year. He won theCandidates with a dominating performance, including two crucial wins at theend against Aronian and Grischuk, and earned the right to play Carlsen for theworld championship in November. He then won the Grenke Super Swiss, ahead ofMagnus. Caruana played brilliantly at the 2018 U.S. Championship, scoring atowering 8-3, way past his main rivals Nakamura and So. The only problem wasCaruana didn't come in first, since he was outpaced by the unlikely surprisewinner grandmaster Sam Shankland, who scored a half point more and wentundefeated in the tournament. (In an email my buddy IM Tony Saidy comparedShankland's U.S. Championship performance to Fischer's 11-0 score against afar weaker field.) Caru looked like he was going to have a bad tournament atAltibox in Norway, since Magnus got his revenge to defeat Fabiano in the veryfirst round. This looked like a gloomy harbinger of their coming match, exceptthat Caru fought back from his first round debacle, eventually caught up withMagnus, and then won the tournament in dramatic fashion by beating Wesley Soin the final round, while Magnus could only draw his game. So harbinger evaded!}) *[Event "?"][Site "?"][Date "????.??.??"][Round "?"][White "Botvinnik 2.0: Caruana's Style"][Black "?"][Result "*"][Annotator "Cyrus Lakdawala"][PlyCount "1"][SourceVersionDate "2018.10.01"]{Chess is a world where we are identified by our styles, as much as ourplaying strength. As chess players we are more than just the sum of our studyand experience. There is something else there - a distinct, one-of-a-kindidentity, which pops up from time to time. If we admire, let's say, a moviestar, we may begin to dress like them, or have our hair done the same way, oradopt their mannerisms of how they speak or walk. In the same way, when weadmire a great player, like Botvinnik or Caruana, we (perhaps subconsciously)begin playing a bit like them, albeit a lot worse! I remember desperatelytrying to emulate Botvinnik's iron logic and Capa and Fischer's frictionlessquality in my play, and maybe a tiny bit of it rubbed off in the end. --- Hereare some of the features of Fabiano's (early) Botvinnikian style. Caruana'schess style is so vibrantly dynamic and alive that, after studying his games,my own games, by comparison, feel as if a zombie plays my side.} 1. Z0 {Caruana is one of those rare players blessed with the ability to switch from aslow positional build-up to irrational tactics, without loss of efficiency ineither mode. He is combative, a high risk taker, in every stage of the game,yet almost always from a strategic vantage point. In this book, we find manyexamples of speculative pawn sacrifices for vague compensation. He also seemsto delight in playing positions with opposite castling, relishing the opposingwing attack war. Caruana's opening preparation is the last word insophistication. He is supremely prepared in this phase of the game and, alongwith Kramnik, is perhaps the best prepared player in the world. In his gameagainst Anand (Game 11), the Indian former world champion hit Caruana with atheoretical novelty. Caruana responded immediately and without thought. He hadalready foreseen Anand's idea and had preparation ready for an idea which hadnever been played before! I still remember the Cub Scouts of Canada motto:"Be prepared." But I logically ask: How on earth was Caruana alreadyprepared for an event which was never supposed to happen? His home analysiswork ethic takes the idea of opening preparation to a never-before-seen level.Caruana, perhaps along with Aronian is in my opinion, is the deepest and mostaccurate pure calculator in the world. Caruana is on par with Magnus Carlsen,when it comes to strategic build-up, planning and slowly improving one'sposition.} (1. Z0 {Conclusion: Caruana unique super-aggressive/strategic stylemakes him a modern day youthful Botvinnik.}) *[Event "?"][Site "?"][Date "????.??.??"][Round "?"][White "Carlsen and Caruana at War"][Black "?"][Result "*"][Annotator "Cyrus Lakdawala"][PlyCount "1"][SourceVersionDate "2018.10.01"]{Sometimes, I find it bizarre that for some of us chess players our self-worthis entirely based upon our rating, or title. For players like Caruana andCarlsen it's a different story, since their burdens, when juxtaposed with ours,differ wildly in magnitude. What they achieve or fail to achieve will berecorded in the history books, unlike the rest of us, where history doesn'treally give a damn if our rating goes over 1900 or remains frustratingly at1895. When we play a chess game we realize - at least subconsciously -that we are not fighting the most important battle in the history of the humanrace. So why does it always feel like we are? Is it an illusion to believethat a single person can make a difference in the world? --- Each worldchampion influences an army of fans, altering their styles and beliefs of whatis possible and what is not on the chess board. It was Shakespeare's Henry Vwho said, "If it is a sin to covet honour, I am the most offending soulalive." Caruana is now the boxing contender who is just one big fight awayfrom being crowned Heavyweight Champion of the World. We all compare the chessplayer we are now to the non-existent player we want to become, and my beliefis that every chess player alive harbours the secret fantasy of becoming worldchampion, if not in this life, then in the next. How does it feel when you aregiven the opportunity to fulfil a lifelong dream? On top of it, the fulfilmentlies solely in your own hands. When the living give fond remembrance to thegreat players who are now dead, do the dead rejoice? Maybe they do, whereverthey are. Most top players run their course, grow old and then all but vanishfrom history's sight. Every top ten player of every generation desperatelycraves the title of world champion with their name beside it, enshriningthemselves forever in history's memory.} 1. Z0 {There remains a singleunanswered question; who is going to win the 2018 World Championship matchbetween grandmaster Fabiano Caruana and world champion Magnus Carlsen? Well, Idon't know, since my deadline for this book is the end of July 2018 and thematch is being played in November. Having now written books on both challengerand champion, I feel that I am at least somewhat qualified to understand thetwo titans' strengths and weaknesses. I'm guessing that Carlsen is anapproximate 55%-45% favourite to retain his title. Let's now compare theirstrengths and weaknesses.} (1. Z0 {1) Opening preparation: Advantage Caruana.To have knowledge of what has come before arms us for battle in the present.Had a chess player spent the last four decades in a coma, he or she would beastounded by the fact that, in our new computer/database era, thinking at theboard is now only optional in the opening stage of the game. Caruana andCarlsen are children of this new age and both have mastered vastly divergentopening repertoires. Yet, in my opinion, Caruana is the greater master in thiselement of the game. In the opening phase, Caruana's often astonishinglydetailed pre-game preparation allows him a familiarity and ease which hiscontemporaries find intimidating enough to dodge their normal openingfavourite lines.}) (1. Z0 {2) Early middlegame: Advantage Caruana, since themomentum of his opening preparation will allow him to coast, even in the earlymiddlegame.}) (1. Z0 {3) Middlegame: 50/50 chances.}) (1. Z0 {4) Latemiddlegame: Advantage Carlsen. The more pieces are removed from the board, thebetter Carlsen's chances become, since he is unrivalled in simplifiedpositions.}) (1. Z0 {5) Endings: Advantage Carlsen, who is clearly the kingover his rivals in the ending. I rank his endgame play in the top three ofall time, in the company of Capablanca and Fischer. Silences come withdifferences. One kind can be peaceful, while the other is ominous. Carlsen'smagic is that he can enter a completely placid ending against a world-classplayer and his opponent's gentle decline is all but imperceptible to everyonewatching, except for one person, Magnus himself. Very few of us look upon acoming dry technical ending and think, "Man, there will be some serious funahead!" Carlsen thinks just that, and why not, since he is one of thegreatest endgame technicians of all time.}) (1. Z0 {6) Clear positions: 50/50chances. Caruana's Botvinnikian logic matches Carlsen's effortless Capablancainsight in clear positions.}) (1. Z0 {7) Irrational positions: AdvantageCarlsen. His astonishing intuition somehow keeps him grounded in the mostdizzying of complications. When he aims his second sight at even the mostirrational of positions, the answer usually returns to him with a clarity onlyhe is capable of seeing. Like a conjurer/magician, Magnus produces resources,seemingly out of nowhere, since his subliminal pattern recognition isunrivalled in the world.}) (1. Z0 {8) Positional play: 50/50. Caruana andCarlsen are, in my opinion, the two deepest strategists in the world today.Both are premier squeezers who make their opponents feel the vice.}) (1. Z0 {9) Attack, Sacrifice and Risk-taking: When attacking it isn't possible topossess an incalculable stock of resources, mainly since the chess board is afinite place, with strict limits. But also keep in mind, as we have seen fromMorphy's famous opera box game, our opponent's numerical superiority doesn'talways translate to victory. The fact that both players are brilliantattackers is hardly a newsworthy item. --- I feel that Carlsen's attacks aremore explosively imaginative than Caru's, yet I still give the edge to Caruanain this category, whose attack-meter registers at a higher level. Caru to mymind is the superior natural attacker, backed up by his comp-like ability tocrunch numbers. Just as his opponents relax, the second wave seems to follow.With Fabiano on the attack, his opponent's position is the prosperous cityskyline, moments before the alien warship's death rays turn it into an instantgraveyard. The scriptures tell us that the devil loves to implant mischief inidle hands. Carlsen is the devil's favourite, since he is in my opinion theone more likely to take grave risks, sometimes past Reason's boundaries. Andwhy not? He gets away with it so often. Yet sometimes it blows up on him.Caruana is the more stable risk-taker of the two, which may or may not be avirtue, since Tal would take Carlsen's side.}) (1. Z0 {10) Defence:Self-preservation is the most primordial of instincts and the rule, don't getyourself mated, is the one inviolable law in chess we can never break. It wasthe Buddha who said that our present pain is the ripening effect of our karmaof past misdeeds. In chess, as in life, when we make mistakes, we sometimesget a second (and sometimes third!) chance. When there is no rational solutionto our troubles, the next best plan is for us to try and bluff or swindle ourway out. --- Here I give the edge to Carlsen, whose defensive fancy footworkis worthy of Jack Dempsey. He is virtually impossible to beat when he doesn'twant to lose. He also tends to wiggle out of more wretched positions thanCaruana is able to. I once saw a blitz match on chess.com where Nakamuratortured Carlsen in a good knight versus bad bishop position. There were onlytwo results possible, Carlsen would lose or the game would end in a draw.Carlsen hung on like grim death, taunted Nakamura to push too hard and, as aresult, Carlsen won an impossible-to-win game against a world-class player.The thing is, he routinely achieves this kind of feat. Sometimes hisphilosophy is, "Why try and amass wealth through hard work, when we canachieve the same result through deceit and embezzlement?" He is also thepremier "finders-keepers" player in the world. We have seen him grabimpossible-to-grab pawns and pieces (some of which would have made Morphyblush with shame) in a sector of the board and in a fight where his opponent'sforces outnumber his own, then miraculously he survives the ordeal andconverts smoothly, in completely inhuman, computer-like fashion.}) (1. Z0 {11) Calculation: Advantage Caruana, who I'm guessing holds a slight edge overCarlsen in this area. We all know from experience that even a fractional errorin our calculation can leave us miles from our intended destination.}) (1. Z0 {12) Intuition: Advantage Carlsen, whose supernaturally powerful intuitionrivals both Capablanca's and Fischer's.}) (1. Z0 {13) Assessment: AdvantageCarlsen. My belief is the main reason Carlsen has held off all challenges (sofar!) and remains world champion is his supernatural ability to correctlyassess an otherwise un-assessable position.}) (1. Z0 {14) Rapid play: Amassive advantage to Carlsen, who is absolutely dominant in the realm of rapidand blitz chess. Why does this matter? Because if the match is a 6-6 tie, thenI assess Caruana's chances at no more than 10% to win the rapid section of thematch. This means that the clock will be running for Caruana in the classicaltime control games and if the score gets to say, 5-5, Caru will be forced intodesperate measures to win, since he needs to avoid a rapid play-off at allcosts.}) (1. Z0 {15) Nerves: 50/50. I don't know who has an edge here. Carlsenhas proven he has incredible nerves when, against Karjakin, he trailed by apoint with only four games remaining in the classical section and managed towin a game to tie the match at 6-6. He then went on to dismantle Karjakin inthe rapid section with ease. --- In the 2018 Candidates' Caruana lost acrucial game to Karjakin, lost his lead and trailed with only two rounds to go.The world prepared for Carlsen-Karjakin II. Instead of going on tilt, Fabianoshowed that he has ice-cold nerves as he managed back-to-back wins againstAronian and Grischuk, to overtake Karjakin and become Carlsen's new challenger.He also won dramatically in the final round at Altibox this year, while Magnusas Black took a quick draw against Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, an outcome thatcost him first place.}) (1. Z0 {16) Natural ability: Advantage Carlsen. Bothplayers were astounding chess Einsteins at birth. My intuition leans to givingthe edge to Carlsen.}) (1. Z0 {17) Creativity: This is thewhen-you-wish-upon-a-star segment. While creativity and imagination are two ofthe most cherished traits in a great player, from the standpoint of results,in my opinion, it's one of the least important. From what I have seen of thetwo players' games, I feel that Carlsen comes up with more original ideas,when it's outside the realm of the opening. But now I ask the importantquestion: is creativity a virtue in chess? The answer is, "sometimes" andcreativity, especially excess creativity, can be a curse as much as a blessing,since Carlsen's heart sometimes fills with impossible to implement aspirations.I give Carlsen no points for winning this category, since unchecked creativepower comes with the demerit of a belief that you are above the law. Carlsenalso loses games when he allows his creativity to run amok, while Caruana ismore dispassionate and is less likely to allow a wild idea to run rampant. Sothis one is a wash. In essence, Caruana is the mathematician/scientist, who isonly interested in the raw data, so he thinks, "Why grasp for somethingwhich we know empirically we have few chances of ever reaching?"; whereasCarlsen is the poet who witnessed a murder and gives a description to thepolice sketch artist: "She had soulful eyes and a whimsically malicioussmile."}) (1. Z0 {18) Consistency: Advantage Carlsen. Magnus can be off form,yet rarely plays unhinged and has a terrible tournament. A bad tournament forhim is second place! I also believe that Caru is slightly more blunder-pronethan Magnus, which can be a critical factor in a short match, since a singleblunder can alter the final outcome.}) (1. Z0 {19) Tactical prowess and theability to find Combinations: I would rate the two players at close to even,with no clear winner in this category.}) (1. Z0 {20) Intangibles: What if oneside is off form and the other on? What if one side is sick for a portion (orworse, the entirety) of the match? What if one of the players has a fight withhis girlfriend, just before a crucial game? The relative shortness of a12-game match also means that if either side loses a game after a string ofdraws, the downside is being induced to play desperately/recklessly. Theseintangibles can throw a logical prediction completely off. It's a differentthing to have a theory and to prove it. I'm certain that Sherlock Holmes andsidekick Dr. Watson deduced that Professor Moriarty was the one who sprinkledarsenic in the Viscount's soup. But how will they prove it to a jury?}) (1. Z0{21) Converting an Advantage: This one is tough to score. A winning positionsometimes fosters complacency. Not with these two. Both parties are highlyefficient in converting advantages, Caruana in middlegames, and Carlsen insimplified positions and endings. I think this one is a wash and score it even.}) *[Event "?"][Site "?"][Date "????.??.??"][Round "?"][White "My prediction"][Black "?"][Result "*"][Annotator "Cyrus Lakdawala"][PlyCount "1"][SourceVersionDate "2018.10.01"]{A hush falls over the readers as I reveal my prediction of the winner. Whowould win the match if Capablanca and Botvinnik lived in the same era andplayed in their primes? So I ran the numbers on their strengths and came tothe conclusion that 13 is a higher number than 7. The final score in thecategories: Caruana 7, Carlsen 13. Remember, though, that not all data isimportant or is a reliable predictor of an outcome. Do you still remember your10th grade high school locker combination? Keep in mind that these predictions,if done by the numbers, are given equal weight, whereas in reality they arenot. There is also the matter of degree. Is Carlsen 12% better than Caruana inthe ending? Is Caruana 10% better than Carlsen in opening theory? We have noway of knowing.} 1. Z0 {Keep in mind that probabilities are not actual realityuntil the match comes to its conclusion. Karjakin played ultra safely in hismatch versus Magnus. I have a feeling that Fabiano won't do that and will gofor it. He may get blown out doing so. On the other hand, if he hits Magnuswith a couple of early blows to the head in the match, Magnus is unlikely torecover. This is not the case of the Rocky I-IV movies. Caru is the underdog,but not that much, since he is the second ranked player in the world. Ifanyone is going to beat Magnus, it will be Fabiano. His life story is notgoing to be reduced to the result of 12 games and history will remember him asone of the all-time greats, no matter what happens in the match. So Caruana'schances may be far closer than my completely subjective numbers indicate. I'mthinking that Carlsen is approximately a 55%-45% favourite to retain his title,with a final match score of +1 at 6½-5½ for Carlsen. I may be correct, or Imay be way off. Only time will tell if your writer is a prophet or a fool inmy prediction. --- Both parties have something to prove. Caruana is rankednumber two in the world and everyone knows number one is a more desirableplace. Also, Carlsen's lifetime score is considerably higher, so Caruana hassomething to prove to the world. Carlsen can't be happy with how this lastyear went, since Caruana upstaged him in the last two tournaments where theycompeted together, taking first in both. So I have a feeling this will be afar more exciting match than Carlsen's two previous matches with Anand and hisrather dull affair against Karjakin, which felt like a match between KarlSchlechter and his twin brother, where every game seemed predestined to end ina dull, technical draw. I predict the long-awaited Carlsen-Caruana match willnot disappoint us.} (1.
