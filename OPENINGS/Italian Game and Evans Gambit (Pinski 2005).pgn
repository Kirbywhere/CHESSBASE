1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. -- {The Italian Game (sometimes referred to
as the Giuoco Piano) is one of the oldest openings around, and also one of the
first lines a player learns when he or she is introduced to chess. It leads to
play that is easy to understand: both sides develop their pieces logically and
begin attacks on the opposing kings. The Italian Game gives both White and
Black the opportunity to play either aggressively and in gambit fashion, or in
a restrained and positional manner. One of White's most exciting and attacking
options is the legendary Evans Gambit, which has been brought back into the
limelight in this modern era by such uncompromising players as World number
one Garry Kasparov, Alexander Morozevich and England's Nigel Short.} (4. -- {
In this book, openings expert Jan Pinski investigates the different strategies
and tactics in the Italian Game and Evans Gambit. Using model games for both
White and Black, Pinski provides crucial coverage of both the main lines and
offbeat variations. This book arms the reader with enough knowledge to play
the Italian Game and Evans Gambit with confidence.}) *

most common opening moves in the last 500 years of chess history, and jump
straight into the third move with...} 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 {Grandmaster
Paul Keres wrote about this move: "too calm to give White advantage." This can,
of course, be discussed, but more importantly we should remember that the
opening is not played in order to gain an advantage, but in order build the
foundation for a later (or occasionally immediate) victory. A theoretical plus
is just one of many ways to gain a practical advantage in a game of chess.
Another is familiarity with the different typical positions. Yet another is
simply knowing the essential theory, or playing a line with which your
opponent is unfamiliar.} Bc5 ({Now let us not get lost in talk, and instead
allow Black to execute his move. Now what about} 3... Bc5 {
here? Does it not have the same defects as 3 Bc4 - ?}) ({Instead} 3... Nf6 {
looks optically better, as it is attacking the pawn on e4; but surely it is
more a matter of taste than of beauty contests at such an early stage in the
game. 3...Nf6 would take us into the past and my previous book on the Two
Knights Defence, while 3...Bc5 leads to the future and the following pages on
the Italian Game, one of the oldest chess openings.}) 4. -- {In this position
White has many ideas and possibilities, but only two give interesting play:} (
4. c3 {with all the main lines of the Italian Game,}) ({
and the 19th century favourite} 4. b4 {, the Evans Gambit.}) ({In this chapter
we shall look at White's less ambitious option, the Four Knights Italian Game:
} 4. Nc3 {.}) (4. -- {Summary: In the notes to the two games below we see that
the Italian Four Knights is theoretically completely harmless. At the same
time we also see that stronger players can outplay their opponents by simple
means, if these opponents have little to show on the day. But then we can lose
against the London System as well. To battle these lines it is more important
to be in good form, than to know theoretical ideas and moves.}) *

Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. c3 {. This is the most interesting and strongest move;
White is building up to enforce 5 d4, which will give him the superiority in
the centre. This is a strategically more aggressive strategy than the symmetry
of the previous chapter, and the source from which the need for real opening
theory on the Italian Game stems.} -- ({

below, I will go as far as to claim an advantage for White in all lines.}) ({

play, achieves only equality, but is successful lower down. After} 4... Nf6 5.

material in this chapter: after 4 c3 then 4...Qe7 has a good reputation, but
probably unjustly. Alekhine-Tarrasch and Tyomkin-Zugic contain some ideas
leading to an advantage for White, which should be of practical importance to
anyone playing the Italian Game. --- In the last two games of the chapter we
investigate Sveshnikov's pet line with 6 e5, which is theoretically quite
harmless. Obviously the Russian grandmaster plays this because he feels that
he gets good practical chances, but against a well-prepared opponent this is
probably not the case. But then again, how many people are prepared for every
obscure line after 1 e4 e5 - ? Not many I suppose...}) *

the official refutation 13...h6! (but also 13...0-0, which seems to lead to a
draw by force). Surely the Möller Attack is having tough times in this

that Black can force equality, but then will have to allow White the chance of
a draw by repetition; or Black can accept a slightly worse position, but play
for a win. For tactical reasons such a line can at times prove reasonable for
White. Van der Doel's weak play in Van den Doel-Sokolov failed to exploit the
pay-offs of this tactic, but the idea still works.}) ({

five games in this chapter Black has nothing to fear from the classical lines
of the Italian Game, short of a short draw that is. The various gambits, the
Möller and 6 0-0, are only dangerous for White and belong to the past. The
main line is also completely harmless and the only problem Black needs to
worry about is how to create winning chances. --- For White, the idea of
winning seems to be far away. If you want to play for a win in the Italian
Game, you need to play 5 d3, as presented in the next chapter.}) *

{As said in the previous chapter I do not believe that there is anything
dangerous to White's play after} 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. c3 Nf6 5. d3
{. Black should always equalise without any real effort. Actually the line
reminds me quite a bit of the 4 d3 line in the Ruy Lopez; sometimes there are
even transpositions between the two openings. --- Having stated once more that
the line is harmless, it is important for me to repeat the old Russian
distinction between drawn positions and equal positions. There are players far
stronger than me who play this line regularly as White and with good results.}
({In Vysochin-Kapnisis and Iordachescu-Gyimesi we shall look at an early} 5. d3
a6 {, where Black retains the idea of playing ...d7-d5 in one move.}) ({
Black will always want to put his bishop on a7 in these quiet lines, so White
sometimes pre-empts this early transposition with a quick} 5. b4 $5 {. The resulting positions of this rapid queenside advance can be seen in
Yudasin-Lenderman and Nevednichy-Gyimesi. In Movsesian-Morozevich White plays
a2-a4 without any apparent plan beyond preventing Black from exchanging the
white bishop with a quick ...Na5.}) ({Finally, in Vysochin-Klovans and
Felgaer-Hector, we will examine positions not too different from the first two
games in the chapter, where we have the Italian with} 5. d3 {
in its purest form.}) 5... -- {Summary: Black has two move orders at his
disposal, and although neither of them is inferior, 5...a6!? does have the
advantage of limiting White's options. For his part, White does not have to
use the move order with 5 d3, but can start with 5 b4!?. This queenside
expansion does not strike me as dangerous, but as in most positions, it is
possible for Black to play badly and lose. --- All in all White can play these
variations in different ways, but at the end of the day Black has a sound,
solid position, and when White does not try to put pressure on it straight
away, he fails to utilise the advantage of the first move. (If you only start
to apply pressure at move 15, the difference between who moved first will have
become so small that in practice it is virtually gone). Black should have a
comfortable life in these lines.} *

is not generally thought of as a path to advantage in the 21st century, it
clearly has not been refuted either. The idea is to gain momentum for opening
the centre, even at the cost of a pawn or two. For this reason the line has
always attracted aggressive players and will probably continue to do so in the
years to come. Even Garry Kasparov found the opening worth playing a few times,
and has used to beat none other than Anand. In this chapter we shall see his
game against a former Dutch No.1, Jeroen Piket, who at the time of the game
was continually improving, with good chances of reaching the world's elite.
These days, however, he has left chess for the less demanding business of

Kasparov-Piket, does not seem to equalise either. Finally, 4...d5!? cannot be
completely disregarded, but White should still find a way to keep the pressure
there, as seen on move 9 in Asker-Miettinen.}) *

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. b4 {"This brilliant attacking opening was
invented to make men understand that chess is a gift from God," wrote Saviely
Tartakower. The inventor of the gambit, William Davies Evans, was born on the
27th January 1790 in Pembrokeshire, South Wales. From 1804 he served in the
navy, and in 1819 reached the rank of captain. In 1824 Evans took command of
the steamer 'Oakland', which carried letters and passengers between England
and Ireland. Evans was introduced to chess in 1818, and very quickly became a
strong player. In the 1820s he was one of best in London. He beat Alexander
McDonnell, John Cochrane and several others among the strongest players of the
day. Evans 'invented' his gambit on a long haul on the sea in 1824, though he
did not have a chance to play it in an actual game before 1827 against
McDonnell. --- The first mention of the 'Evans Gambit' in print is found in
Levison's 'Lessons on the Game of Chess' from 1832. It is not unfair to say
that the Evans Gambit was the Ruy Lopez of the 19th century. It was simply one
of the most popular openings, if not the most popular. At the turn of the
century, however, the Evans Gambit disappeared from top chess for almost 100
years. First of all, because people became tired of it and wanted to explore
new paths. Secondly, because strong defensive players, such as World Champions
Wilhelm Steinitz and Emanuel Lasker, found ways for Black to get a good game
against 4 b4!?. --- Nevertheless, in the 21st century the Evans has proven to
be quite resilient to the threats presented to different romantic gambits by
the silicon monsters.} Bb6 {Black refuses the challenge and keeps his bishop
well placed. Though to some extent a strategy for wimps, it cannot be
automatically ignored. As far as I can see White can achieve an opening
advantage by transposing to the notes to Nevednichy-Gyimesi from Chapter 4
(see the notes to move 6 below).} ({After the more passive} 4... Be7 5. b5 Na5

Rather it is an attempt to return the pawn and fight for the centre. White can
choose between different ways of contesting this strategy, all leading to
interesting play, but no clear path to an advantage is apparent. 7 Be2 and 8

Summary: The 'standard position' covered in this chapter after 5...Bc5 6 d4
exd4 7 0-0 d6 8 cxd4 Bb6 seems to be rather dangerous for Black. White can
generate a real initiative with 9 Nc3!, while also 9 d5 seems to hold some
venom. Eventually the theoretical conclusion might settle with Black being OK,
but for the practical player it is more important to know that Black will
always have to play very accurately to survive, while White's initiative seems
pretty natural. Not surprisingly Black scores a record low 37% with this line,
compared to the more average 44% with 5...Ba5 and 45% with 5...Be7.} *

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. b4 Bxb4 5. c3 Ba5 {The retreat with 5...Ba5
is perhaps the most natural answer to the Evans Gambit. The bishop remains on
the e1-a5 diagonal, pinning the c3 and d2 pawns for the moment and, more
importantly, is not in any kind of trouble on a5. On the minus side White will
be able to put pressure on the black position with Ba3 later on. Black is
clearly planning to meet this with ...d7-d6. Black will establish a strong
point on e5 and try to keep the centre closed for as long as is reasonably
possible.} ({The retreat} 5... Ba5 {was apparently first played in a not very

presented in this chapter indicate that Black has several sound ways of
meeting 6 0-0, one of them being the 'Lasker Defence' with 6...d6 7 d4 Bb6. I
believe that the main reason for this is that the advantages for White of
having castled are slightly more long term than those of an immediate attack
on the black centre with 6 d4 (as in the next chapter). Therefore I do not
feel that the lines with 6 0-0 are truly dangerous for Black.}) *

Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. b4 Bxb4 5. c3 Ba5 6. d4 {. This is Howard Staunton's idea,
which has the advantage that White can avoid Lasker's Defence (as seen in
Chapter 8) by answering} d6 {with something other than} 7. O-O {. Basically
White is putting time over material, which is of course a risky strategy. But
as they say... he who risks nothing gains nothing.} (7. -- {Summary: After 5...
Ba5, 6 d4 is the most dangerous line for Black, but it does not seem to
generate enough pressure to guarantee White an advantage. Black should be able
to hold his own with both 6...d6 and the slightly more adventurous 6...exd4 7
0-0 Nge7!. --- Nevertheless, I believe that there is plenty of room for
improvements on both sides, and that the Evans Gambit will prove a dangerous
weapon into the 21st century. Especially when the opponents are not 2700+
super-grandmasters, and have not checked everything with a computer years in
advance. --- So, although the Spanish gives more promise of a theoretical
advantage, the Evans Gambit gives better chances of actually winning the game.
It is the opening for those players who hate to compromise.}) *

--- The Hungarian Defence with 3...Be7 is another story. As can be seen in
this chapter, after the theoretical 4 d4 Black gets a reasonable game with
both 4...exd4 and 4...d6. White might be on the verge of an edge in some lines,
