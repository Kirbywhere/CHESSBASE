Bycontinually challenging the reader to answer probing questions throughout thebook, the Move by Move format greatly encourages the learning and practisingof vital skills just as much as the traditional assimilation of openingknowledge. Carefully selected questions and answers are designed to keep youactively involved and allow you to monitor your progress as you learn. This isan excellent way to study any chess opening and at the same time improve yourgeneral chess skills and knowledge. --- The Catalan is a solid opening systemin which White combines the Queen’s Gambit with a kingside fianchetto. Inrecent years it has become an increasingly popular choice at all levels ofchess, and elite grandmasters such as Vladimir Kramnik have developed majornew ideas for both White and Black. The Catalan can lead to a wide variety ofpositions, open or closed, tactical or strategic, that will suit players ofall styles. In this book, Grandmaster Neil McDonald invites you to join him instudying the Catalan and its many variations. McDonald shares his experienceand knowledge of the Catalan, examines the main plans for both sides andprovides answers to the key questions.} 1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. g3 {.

In contrast to the Queen's Gambit Declined, where Bd3 or Be2is usually played, White will develop the bishop to g2. --- There are a lot ofbeautiful positional ideas in the Catalan. You can only admire the way Kramnikand Giri and So and Caruana use the bishop on g2 like a magician's wand. Thespells they cast mean that their opponents play a series of natural, halfdecent moves and find themselves in a lost position with no idea why. --- Thegood thing for White in most lines of the Catalan Opening is that if he playsprecisely, Black never quite equalizes - he is almost completely equal, butWhite's tiny advantage usually lingers on a long time, right until the endgame.It is a rather unpleasant affair for Black to be always a bit worse, and if heis careless his fears about his position can grow from slight anxiety toserious alarm. --- Sometimes White can do everything right in the Catalan, buthis advantage turns out to be of a symbolic rather than real nature. Forexample, he obtains an endgame with a better pawn structure or a superiorbishop, but a few vigilant moves by Black and it is time to agree a draw.Never mind: you can't win at chess unless your opponent gives you some help.There's always the next game. --- Is there any drawback to the Catalan? Yes:abandon hope all ye who want to smash your opponents in 20 moves with akingside attack! It can be done - there are some nice sacrificial attacks inthis book - but, well, it requires Black to stir up trouble for himself byresponding in risky style. --- The bishop on g2 is pointing the wrong way ifyou want to get at your opponent's king. Some players are consummatepositional players, but are easily bowled over by direct attacks. You aren'tgiving yourself the chance to exploit this weakness in the Catalan. Insteadyou are planning a rook invasion on c7 in 10 moves' time. --- It is, of course,a question of style and what you are looking for from the opening. If you wanta safe game with few losing chances and a small plus, then the Catalan is foryou. If you like grinding out wins in rook and pawn endgames it will suit youfine. --- Despite the rather gloomy prognosis for Black above, I have examinedsome interesting counter measures for him. Almost all of the world elite areprepared to defend against the Catalan and have introduced many weaponsagainst it. --- This book aims to cover all the important ideas in everyvariation of the Catalan. Inevitably there will be gaps as it is such a wide,strategically complex and ever developing opening. I can only apologise inadvance for any omissions.} (4. -- {Neil McDonald, Gravesend, April 2017}) *[Event "?"][Site "?"][Date "????.??.??"][Round "?"][White "Move Orders & Transpositions"][Black "?"][Result "*"][Annotator "Neil McDonald"][PlyCount "1"][SourceTitle "The Catalan MBM"][Source "Everyman Chess"][SourceDate "2017.08.07"]{I would recommend you look at some of the games in this book and get a feelfor the Catalan before reading this section.

Qc2 {QUESTION: Is this a strong andsensible move? --- ANSWER: Yes! On c2 the white queen defends the c4-pawn,ruling out any pawn snatch with ...d5xc4 followed by ...b7-b5 clinging on tothe material. Also thinking about the c-file, in this type of structureBlack's so-called freeing move is ...c7-c5. If he can carry out this pawnbreak without incurring any immediate disadvantage he has good chances toequalize. The queen's presence on c2 deters the advance. Speaking moregenerally, the white queen vacates the d1-square for a rook, probably the oneon f1, to support the d4-pawn. And, finally, she also aims at the e4-square insupport of White's plan which is discussed below.} b6 {With this reply Blackcontinues his logical scheme of development: his queen's bishop will go to b7,then the knight on b8 will be developed to d7 (jumping ahead I should say thislooks like a mistake – see the note to Black's 9th, below), and the rook froma8 will be shifted to c8. Finally he will be ready to strike out with theaforementioned ...c7-c5, which will be all the more effective in view of thewhite queen's somewhat exposed position on c2.} 8. Nbd2 $1 {One of thetrademarks of the Catalan is that White avoids a quick development of hisqueen's knight. He waits to see what is the best square for it. In thisexample Naiditsch plans to use the horse to support the pawn advance e2-e4,but doesn't want to allow ...d5xc4 without the chance to recapture. Thereforehe puts the knight on d2 rather than c3, which would interfere with hisqueen's defence of the c4-pawn. --- We shall see that in certain variationsWhite chooses to play Nc3 rather than Nbd2. However, these tend to be lesspopular, more speculative tries for advantage. Or perhaps White was denied thechance to be flexible as he chose c3 for the knight before he knew for sure itwas going to be a Catalan. --- A delayed development of the queen's knight,which probably goes to d2 in the end, is far more characteristic of theCatalan.} Bb7 9. e4 {QUESTION: I'm still slightly confused why 4...Bb4+ 5 Bd2Be7 is recommended instead as the correct procedure for Black. After all, he'gifts' White the developing move Bd2. How big a difference would it make tothe game – a slight or big change? --- ANSWER: We can debate whether thewhite bishop is better on d2 than c1 – White might find a way to justify itsplacing on d2, or find a use for the vacated c1-square. However, the mainpoint is that White's smooth build-up with Nbd2 and e2-e4 would have beenobstructed because his knight is denied the d2-square. This seems tosignificantly outweigh any benefits for White in having shifted his bishop tod2 'for free'. --- As a rule, if White can achieve the e2-e4 advance beforeBlack can respond ...d5xc4 and ...c7-c5 in a safe way he will have a good game.--- EXERCISE: What do you now think is the best move for Black out of thefollowing choice: 9...dxe4, 9...Na6 and 9...Nbd7 - ?} Nbd7 $6 {The game move 9...Nbd7 proves one routine move too many.} ({ANSWER: Here} 9... dxe4 10.

By giving a check on b4 Black has enticedWhite's bishop to d2. You might think this is a free developing move for White,but the bishop is poorly placed on d2 and will have to be reassigned to a moreactive square later on, most likely f4. So White hasn't gained a move.Furthermore, the bishop is blocking the d2-square and so preventing Nbd2 byWhite which in combination with Qc2 would allow him to advance in the centrequickly with e2-e4. This is the clever point of Black's check on b4. He hasdisrupted White's smooth build-up. Looking more closely, we might say thatWhite's bishop would be better still on c1, so that it can be developed withb2-b3 and Bb2, which along with Qc2, Nbd2 and e2-e4 would be White's optimumbuild-up.}) 6.

Qc2 c6 {With his previous move Whitedefends c4, positions the queen to support a possible e2-e4 central advance,and clears the d1-square for use by a rook to bolster the centre. Blackstrengthens his centre in response and gets his c-pawn off a potentiallyvulnerable square on c7. He has two basic aims: to develop his queen's bishop,and thereafter to achieve the freeing advance ...c6-c5. He hopes to carry outboth operations without incurring any serious weaknesses in his pawn structure.In the Catalan, this is easier said than done.} 9. Rd1 {QUESTION: What exactlyis the point of this move? --- ANSWER: White's move is an example of whatNimzowitsch termed a 'Mysterious Rook Move': the rook goes to a blocked linebecause White anticipates that Black will try to free himself with ...c6-c5 orwith ..d5xc4 when lines will open up. Paradoxically in the game the rook onlybecomes useful on d1 thanks to Black's help. Though if Black played passivelyWhite could always aim to lever the centre open with a well-planned e2-e4advance. --- The move 9 Rd1 might also be described as a useful waiting move.White knows that Black needs to develop his queen's bishop: therefore he makesa good centralizing move in anticipation of Black loosening himself on thec-file.} b6 {Of course, the bishop can't sit on c8 forever, but now White hasa target on the c-file. At first glance this might seem a very simple position:White will exert some queenside pressure with straightforward attacking moves,while Black will respond with solid defensive moves. Common sense will prevailwith both players making decisions according to classical precepts. ---However, the deeper we look, the more we realize this is actually an extremelydifficult position. There are many subtle points which have been tested in toplevel games. For example, Black must consider: in what scenarios should thebishop go to a6 rather than b7? Should I play ...a7-a5 - ?

(c) Fix Black'spawns on dark squares with a2-a4 followed by exchanging queens then Nc4. ---ANSWER: White is slightly better. First we notice that he has control of thec-file. Less obvious is the fact that the white knight is stronger here thanthe black bishop. --- Everything else being equal, it is usually better tohave a bishop in an endgame, but here White's pawns are solid and compact.There is nothing for Black's bishop to attack as White's queenside pawns aresafely on light squares. --- Meanwhile Black's pawns on a5 and b6 are slightlyfragile. Despite the knight's superiority, Giri would be more than happy toexchange his knight for the bishop if in doing so he ties down Black's rooksto the defence of their queenside pawns. --- If you put Black's pawn back ona7 then it is difficult to see any advantage for White. If you put the pawnson a6 and b5 it also looks equal. However, with the pawns on a5 and b6 as inthe game, the b6-pawn is slightly vulnerable. It can be attacked in the longterm with Rc6 or Nc4. If Black advances it to b5 then it remains open toattack with Rc5. Then the further advance b3-b4 would leave Black with a weakpawn on a5 that could be attacked with Rc5 and Nc4. --- It might seem a tiny,almost nebulous advantage for White in the diagram position and, indeed,Topalov is very close to equality, but as you will see the former world numberone rated player was unable to defend it.

This seems paradoxical as the knight on d2 isdefinitely centralized, right? And yet it's easy to see what the great Danishmaster was getting at. The white knight sits on d2 with a circumscribed viewof the world as it has access to neither of the central squares c4 or e4. Itsenemy in this respect is the pawn on d5: if that can be removed then the whiteknight will have increased scope, but even then it will probably be doing lesswork than on the post on c3 it spurned. We might say that Nbd2 decentralizedthe knight as it denied it the influence over the d5-square it would havegained with Nc3. --- And as David Bronstein suggested, we might also ask theopinion of the other pieces. What does the bishop on c1 think about being shutin by the knight? Is the rook on a1 grumbling that it will take even longer tosee daylight? Is the white queen pleased about having her view of thed4-square blocked? Not much, probably. --- In defence of 6 Nbd2, it might besaid that if Black only knows the 6 Qc2 dxc4 lines, or is making up theopening as he goes along, he is likely to be taken aback by the quiet knightmove.} ({Not liking the look of} 6... dxc4 7.

In answer to the question aboveabout where White is going to attack, the answer is everywhere: on thequeenside, in the centre and on the kingside. However, first of all heundermines Black's queenside pawns. Imagine if Black now plays 13...cxb3.After 14 axb3 in reply we have the diagram position below. --- It's importantto grasp the nature of White's strategic pawn sacrifice, as it will occur invarious lines where Black has played an early ...d5xc4 and held on to the pawn.--- Black is still a pawn up. However, his queenside structure has lost almostall its dynamism with the disappearance of the c4-pawn. Instead of threateningto roll forwards en masse, the pawns are a liability and will need defendingby the pieces. Things are particularly awkward as White has a rook bearingdown along the c-file at the vulnerable knight and beyond it the backward pawnon c7. --- There is also a nasty hole on the c5-square which is inviting forWhite's knight. However, Black can play 14...Be7 and be ready to exchange offthe knight for his bishop when it sets foot on c5. So we could refine White'splay after 13...cxb3 with the interpolation 14 Nxf6+ Qxf6 and only then 15axb3. Then Black's defences along the c-file have been weakened as the blackqueen has been deflected from d8 where it defended c7. --- A case could alsobe made for 14 Nxf6+ Qxf6 15 Qxb3. White could then follow up with Rc5 anddouble rooks along the c-file, with the white queen perhaps going to a3 toattack a6. A possible drawback to retaking on b3 with the queen is that thec4-square isn't defended, so White would have to watch out for ...Na5 and ...Nc4 by Black. --- Whether White recaptures with the queen or pawn, orinterposes 14 Nxf6+ Qxf6 or not, he has full compensation for the pawn deficit.In fact his game is preferable, or at least easier to play, as sooner or laterhe is likely to regain his pawn whilst keeping the initiative.} Be7 {Ratherthan assume a defensive attitude Potkin decides to return the pawn.

Furthermore, the sequence ...Nf6, ...Nd5 and ...Nxe3 has taken three moves, giving White a lead indevelopment. His bishop on g2 enjoys an open diagonal and his knight on e5 iswell centralized. It will be difficult for Black to shake off White's grip inthe centre. --- The drawbacks for White of the exchange are that everythingelse being equal it is normally unwelcome to have to exchange a bishop for anenemy knight. Though compared to most opening lines White is more willing thanusual to swap his dark-squared bishop for a knight in the Catalan. --- Of moreconcern for White is that the e3-pawn looks vulnerable.

Furthermore, White might go the wholehog and advance b4-b5, to force the black knight away from c6, when it alsoloses contact with the d4-square.

You mightlike to make a list. --- ANSWER: Firstly, Black is solidly centralized andactually has a lead in development. Secondly, at the moment White's queensidepawns are passive on a2 and b2. They are a long way from being utilized asbattering rams against the black king. This gives Black time to organizecounterplay and fortify her defences. --- The pressure from the bishop on g2can be plugged with ...Nd5. Because Black has played ...d5xc4 the horse can'tbe driven back by c2-c4. Alternatively if White tries e3-e4 to evict theknight then d4 becomes weak and the bishop on g2 is shut in by its own pawn.Of course, the knight won't be entirely stable sitting on d5, but it is aserious obstacle to White's attack. --- Aggressively speaking, Black has asource of counterattack on the kingside. It transpires that with 4 g3 Whitehas created a hook for the pawn advance ...h5-h4. The disappearance of theknight on f3 facilitates this ramming move. Furthermore, the situation in thecentre isn't entirely fixed.

What do you think of White'squeen sacrifice? --- ANSWER: The knight has returned to e4 to block in thebishop on g2 and put a barrier against a white rook on e1- not that it isa very secure barrier, as we shall see. --- If a positional queen sacrificefor a rook and bishop is going to work then the giver needs a safe king and asolid pawn structure. Above all, the opponent mustn't have a strong passedpawn, which doesn't apply here. So on the whole White is looking at least okay.The problem will appear when in order to get rid of the knight on e4 he isobliged to compromise his kingside, after which his king becomes a strategicfactor - not what you want when your opponent has an unopposed queen.

Bxf6 Nxf6 {Black must recapture thisway or White plays 14 e4 after all. White is often content to give up thefabled bishop pair in the Catalan, although first of all, we should be moreprecise: White is seldom happy to swap his light-squared bishop for a knightin the Catalan. His bishop on g2 is often key to his strategy, and in such anexchange, he would like to have an extra pawn to cheer himself up (see the 7Ne5 Nc6 8 Bxc6 bxc6 9 Nxc6 line). We might add though that White is oftenhappy to exchange it off in return for Black's light-squared bishop. --- Incontrast, it is often even desirable for White to swap his dark-squared bishopfor a knight. This is because the light-squared bishop has a nice haven fromthe bustle of the centre on g2 and a clear strategic role. In contrast thebishop on c1 normally has no safe and useful square away from the centre -apart from in the 8 Qxc4 mainline, where it sometimes finds its nirvanathrough the manoeuvre Bd2 and Ba5. --- White's pawn on d4 helps to clutter thedark squares, reducing the options for his bishop. And generally speaking theblocked nature of the struggle - there are still seven pawns on the boardin both armies - reduces the value of the bishop over the knight.Furthermore, Bg5 and Bxf6 often has the good point of deflecting the otherblack knight from the build-up to a freeing ...c7-c5 or ...e6-e5 advance. Infact it not only slows down Black's preparation of ...c7-c5, but also clearsthe c1-square with gain of time, thereby facilitating a Rac1 move to obstruct ...c7-c5. --- EXERCISE: White wants to advance on the queenside. Should he play14 a5 or 14 b4? --- ANSWER:} 14. a5 {A move needs to be judged on what it doesfor a player's strategic chances, and also on what it takes away from theopponent. Everything else being equal, being one square forwards makes a pawnmore valuable in an endgame. The reason is simple: it is one step closer tobeing a queen. --- Here the pawn physically blocks Black from advancing 14...a5 himself. This would equalize space on the queenside and make the b4-squarea strong point for Black - or if you prefer a hole in White's pawnstructure. White no longer has a dark-squared bishop to fight for theb4-square, and the b2-pawn remains restrained. --- By advancing 14 a5 Whitefixes a space advantage for himself on the queenside, rather than having hisown b-pawn restrained by ...a6-a5.} ({After} 14. b4 {Black has the concretereply} Bd5 $1 {. Now if the white queen retreats b4 drops, so we have thesequence} 15. Nxd5 exd5 16. Qb3 c6 {.

Bd2 $1 {Other moves areanalyzed later in the chapter. --- QUESTION: What is the point of this moveand why has it got an exclamation mark? --- ANSWER: In the Catalan White'sbishop on f1 has a lot of care lavished on it. Right at the beginning of thegame two moves are spent on establishing it in a safe and comfortableresidence on g2. Not so the bishop on c1. It finds its activity circumscribedby its own pawn on d4 and sometimes on e3 as well. And so it is frequentlysent off to f4 or g5 where White is somewhat relieved when it is exchanged offfor a knight. --- However, then another route for the bishop was discovered:it could go to d2 and shoot off to a5, where it has a key role in attackingBlack's backward pawn on c7. The circumstances have to be right for Ba5 to bea good idea, but even if they aren't, the latent threat of Ba5 is annoying forBlack.} Nbd7 {Blagojevic develops and pointedly ignores the idea behind hisopponent's last move.} ({We'll look at the alternatives} 10...

Then the bishop'sforay 11 Ba5? could be rebuffed by 11...Nc6, gaining time to develop andforcing the cleric into shamefaced retreat. In fact as long as the blackknight is on b8 playing Ba5 looks dubious, but of course the black knightcan't remain forever on b8. A situation might arise where both players arelooking around for useful waiting moves, White not wanting to play Ba5 andBlack not wanting to play ...Nbd7 or ..Nc6. --- If White is unable to land hisbishop on a5, it still has a possible role on d2 in supporting the pawnadvance b2-b4, to put a clamp on the c5-square.

Nbd2 {EXERCISE: Give some reasons why this is a better square for the knight than c3.--- ANSWER: From d2 the knight has the option of going to b3 to add its weightto the fight for the c5-square. At the moment this square is a hole in Black'squeenside pawn structure, but the defect would vanish should Black be able toadvance ...c7-c5. Therefore it is critical that all the white piecescontribute to restraining this freeing move. --- On c3 the knight wouldn'thave access to any useful squares and blocks the white queen's pressure on c7.Even worse, it cuts off the retreat of the bishop on a5. Black could changehis mind about developing his knight and respond 12...Nb8! with the threat of13...Nc6, attacking both the bishop and the pawn on d4. White has no good wayto meet this.

In other games White has tried to exploit this withideas such as Nh4 or Ng5, exchanging the light-squared bishops, and then e2-e4;or Re1 and e2-e4; or Nc3 and e2-e4: or by pinning the knight on f6 with Bg5and then Bxf6 and e2-e4. Black, for his part, has defensive resources based onarranging ...e6-e5. --- Instead Caruana settles for 'normal' queensidepressure, planning b2-b4 to bolster his control over the c4-square. Any e2-e4advance will come later (jumping ahead it will come on move 40!).} ({Divergingfrom} 10... Nbd7 {in the previous game.}) 11. a3 Nbd7 12. b4 ({Black hasachieved good results after} 12. Ba5 Qb8 13. b4 e5 $1 {. The centre isdissolving and White's bishop on a5 seems somewhat shut out of things.Therefore Caruana renounces the plan of Ba5. He puts a pincer grip on thec5-square and develops his pieces with Bc3 and Nbd2, looking to restrain Blackin the centre or at least derive maximum benefit from the opening of lines ifBlack arranges ...e6-e5. --- Notice also that the bishop on d2 deters anattempt to loosen the hold on c5 with 12...a5, as after 13 bxa5 it would bedifficult for Black to get his pawn back. --- You might be asking yourself whya top-class player like Karjakin would aim for a position where he is underpressure with not much by way of activity to show for it? Surely there areeasier ways to play as Black? --- Well, first of all we shall see that Blackhas more chances for activity than is apparent at first glance, but in anycase Black has only one real weakness in this position, the c7-pawn, and ifyou are a top player you don't lose because of one weakness. Karjakin andother super-GM defenders of Black in the mainline Catalan have confidence intheir powers. They believe they will be able to contain White's advantage, andmost of the time they are right. --- As I said above, Karjakin hardly everloses in the Catalan. And a look at the results of games between 2700 playersin this variation conforms that he is right to trust this variation as Black.Of course, it is different with the players you and I face in tournaments.They don't want a prospectless defence. To most of them chess is a hobby and (I know it sounds extraordinary) they actually want to enjoy playing it!})12...

Qa8 $1 {EXERCISE: Try to work out why Karjakin prefers a8 forhis queen rather than e7. --- ANSWER: The queen takes possession of the squarevacated by 12...Ra7. Notice that in terms of influence she is just ascentralized here as on e7, or even more so, as she looks down the longdiagonal at some key light squares. She adds her weight to that of the bishopon e4 and knight on f6 in restraining a future e2-e4 space grab by White.Furthermore, she pins the knight on f3 which reduces White's freedom of actionand might facilitate a ...e6-e5-pawn break to liquidate the white centre.

Ne1 $1 {QUESTION: What does White achieve with thisknight retreat? --- ANSWER: First of all, White escapes the pin on f3 in a waythat defends his bishop.

Meanwhile the whiteknight can re-emerge from e1 on d3 where it controls the c5- and e5-squares,or on g2 after an exchange of bishops there. --- The exchange of light-squaredbishops often facilitates White exploiting the weaknesses in Black's queensidestructure.

Given the chance White will play moves like Rc1 and a2-a3 (tostop ...Nb4) then Ne1, attacking c6 and with the plan of Nd3 aiming forcontrol of the c5-square. If White can arrange Nc5 in this type of structureand oblige Black to respond with ...Bxc5 then after Qxc5 he will be close towinning from a positional viewpoint due to Black's weak dark squares and thecontinuing pressure along the c-file. However, if after Nc5 and ...Bxc5 Whitewas obliged to recapture d4xc5, then most of his advantage vanishes: theattack along the c-file is blocked and Black is entrenched on the lightsquares.

Now 16 Qxd6? cxd6 would be a miserable exchangefor White - the weakling previously on c7 now defends the c5- ande5-squares, and the black rook on c8 is presented with an open file. Thereforein order to assert his control over the c-file White is obliged to allow theexchange of queens when he has a rook on the c6-square.
