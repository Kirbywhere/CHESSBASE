Rather than set out a defensive stall with systemsbased on moves such as ...e6 and ...c6, Black prefers to initiative immediatepiece play in the centre. The benefits of this strategy are that Black'squeenside pieces, which are often difficult to develop in the Queen's Gambit,participate in the struggle at once. The queen's knight emerges immediatelyonto an active square and the path is left free for the c8-bishop to developfreely. Naturally there are also drawbacks as Black will not find it easy toestablish a foothold in the centre in the early play. --- The Chigorin is aperfect counterattacking weapon and will appeal to players who like to throwopponents onto their own resources at an early stage. Jimmy Liew identifiesand analyses the precise moments when specific theoretical knowledge isrequired and also discussed plans and strategies in the quieter variations.} (2...

He was never world champion but was one of the mainchallengers, contesting (and losing) two matches against Wilhelm Steinitz. ---Chigorin first tried 2...Nc6 against another great player, Harry Pillsbury, inthe St. Petersburg "Four Masters" tournament in 1895/96. In their firstgame, Pillsbury quickly built up a strong position, won material, andconverted it precisely. This was certainly not the most auspicious start for anew opening - but Chigorin persevered with it, scored a win and a draw intheir next two games, and won again in London three years later. He continuedto employ} 1. d4 d5 2. c4 ({and his companion line} 2. Nf3 Bg4 $5) 2... Nc6 {in the top tournaments of his day, albeit with mixed results. --- Notably,Black refuses for the moment to support the d5-pawn with either ...e7-e6 or ...c7-c6, relying instead on piece play to put pressure on the white centre. Healso blocks the c-pawn from advancing to c5, which is Black's typical breakin the Queen's Gambit.} 3. Z0 ({One of the key themes of the opening isallowing the exchange of White's c-pawn for Black's d-pawn, establishing awhite majority in the centre - in return Black obtains quick and easydevelopment. This theme is seen in several of the main lines, such as} 3. cxd5Qxd5 4. e3 e5 5. Nc3 Bb4 {(Chapter One, Games 3-16);}) (3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Nf3 dxc45. e4 Bg4 {(Chapter Two, Games 32-37);}) ({and} 3. Nf3 Bg4 4. cxd5 Bxf3 5. gxf3Qxd5 6. e3 e5 7. Nc3 Bb4 {(Chapter Three, Games 48-54). In all of these, Blackmust be prepared to give up a bishop for a knight, sometimes both bishops, inorder to maintain the activity of his other pieces.}) (3. Z0 {The Chigorin istherefore often regarded as a dynamic opening but somewhat anti-positional,and to be more of an occasional/surprise weapon than a mainstream one.Nonetheless, numerous grandmasters have used it regularly and successfully -including (by database games total) Igor Miladinovic, Nenad Fercec, IljaZaragatski, Alexander Morozevich, Aleksandr Karpatchev, Alexander Raetsky,Robert Rabiega and Petr Tishin. --- At the very least, Black'snon-conformist knight move takes the fight to the opponent from the beginningof the game, which can lead to very interesting play at all levels of chess.})(3.

The first time} 1. d4 d5 2. c4Nc6 {appeared on the board, in Vienna 1898, Steinitz opted for} 3. cxd5 Qxd5 {, which is a direct attempt at refuting the Chigorin. White is asking Black toprove that his piece versus centre strategy is valid. In other words, Whitedoes not believe in the correctness of Black's opening. --- From the otherside, the fact that White is now obliged to defend the d4-pawn gives Blacktime to push ...e7-e5, then which enables him to answer Nc3 with ...Bb4,pinning the knight, rather than retreat the queen from its central post. Thisis the correct course even against} 4. Nf3 {and is a standard motif of theChigorin, Black offering a pawn in order to bring his pieces to very activepositions. If White opts to take on e5 he probably does best to give the pawnback in exchange for the bishop pair, but in that case there is little pointin taking it at all.} ({Hence the main lines begin} 4. e3 e5 5.

Z0 {Summary: Black has two thematicreplies to White's 3 Nc3, respectively 3...Nf6 and 3...dxc4. These veryoften transpose (after 4 Nf3), while allowing White different options on movefour. --- After 3...dxc4 the main alternative is 4 d5, hitting the c6-knight.Sending it to the edge with 4...Na5 (as in Game 21) commits Black to aspeculative piece sacrifice, which is not considered quite correct but can bevery effective when unleashed against an unsuspecting opponent. Black gets two(sometimes three) connected pawns that can roll down like molten lavadestroying everything in their path. It might not be one to play at thehighest level but most readers of this book are unlikely to be contesting inthe Candidates. Moreover, 4...Ne5 is no less complicated (see Games 22-23), asthe knight can be kicked again by f2-f4, when Black has to play precisely tostay in the game. --- If Black prefers to avoid all that, there is the quieter3...Nf6, awaiting further events. If White then captures on d5 and follows upwith e2-e4, we reach a Grünfeld-type pawn structure without a fianchettoedg7-bishop. As in the 3 cxd5 lines of Chapter One, Black should respond with anquick ...e7-e5 to challenge White in the centre (see Games 17-19). --- In bothcases, if White simply develops with 4 Nf3, Black should play whichever of thetwo moves (...Nf6 or ...d5xc4) he hasn't already played, either way reachingthe same position. White then has various possibilities, such as 5 d5, 5 e3and 5 Bg5 (Games 25-31), but the most common is to seize the centre with 5 e4,after which Black plays 5...Bg4, pinning the knight. The consequences of themain line 6 Be3 e6 7 Bxc4 Bb4 are examined in Games 33-37. Careful note shouldalso be taken of GM Dragan Solak's 6 Bxc4!? in the notes to Game 32.Although this has only been seen in a handful of master games so far (seven tobe precise, and just one with 9 Be2!), it may yet prove critical to Black'sentire set-up after 3 Nc3, so it is important to study it properly.}) 1/2-1/2[Event "?"][Site "?"][Date "????.??.??"][Round "?"][White "3: The Solid 3 Nf3"][Black "?"][Result "*"][ECO "D07"][Annotator "Jimmy Liew"][PlyCount "7"][SourceTitle "MBM: Chigorin"][Source "Everyman Chess"][SourceDate "2018.11.30"][SourceVersion "1"]{After} 1. d4 d5 2. c4 Nc6 3.
