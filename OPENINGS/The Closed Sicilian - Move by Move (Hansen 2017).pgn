through to the next round of a knockout tournament. I suppose both players
were getting short of time because the rest of the game contains an unusual
amount of errors. Black's next move is the first inaccuracy, but the mistakes
get a lot bigger, and both players join in the mêlée, which makes it very
entertaining.} Ng8 $6 {Black is concerned about the king's safety and guards

dangerous than his own ...b6-b5-b4 break on the queenside, especially now that
the white rook has left the f-file. However, the game doesn't turn out that
way, and the black b-pawn doesn't reach its destination for another thirty
moves. QUESTION: What about Black's king? ANSWER: With the centre blocked, the
king is safe enough where it is and could, in any case, theoretically castle
either way at any moment.} ({Instead, Black should probably consider} 15... Rc8

What is this madness? ANSWER: It is not so mad. In fact this a typical idea in
the French Defence, which the game now resembles; the king is usually quite
safe on d7 and meanwhile the black rooks are connected. All the same, the
position is more difficult for Black than he perhaps anticipated.} 20. Ne3 ({
White might also consider} 20. Bf6 $5 {.} {But if Black defends the bishop

QUESTION: I don't understand this move. Wasn't Black supposed to play on the
queenside? ANSWER: He was, but apparently he felt that White is making so much
progress on the kingside that Black needs to take active countermeasures there.
QUESTION: To whose advantage is such a change in the position? ANSWER: In
general, it has to be White who benefits the most, since his pieces are better
placed, while the e5-square and black pawn on e6 become permanent weaknesses.
On the other hand, if Black does nothing, White will just continue to build up
until his initiative becomes overwhelming. In that sense, Black's move is a
risk worth taking, and it pays off to the extent that White fails to find the
strongest continuation.} 26. exf6 Bxf6 27. Rh3 $6 ({White continues to take

observation about the coordination of the white pieces, you are absolutely
right, it looks a little odd, but there are no real threats on either side so
this is perfectly fine for now. That said, Black's latest move does not
accomplish much either. In fact, in what follows, Black seems to be playing

counterplay.}) 18. Rad1 Rc8 19. Qe2 h5 {QUESTION: Isn't it risky to play like
this for Black, exposing the king by moving the kingside pawns forward? ANSWER:
Good point! Normally you would not recommend such a strategy. Here Black wants
to lay claim to the g4-square in order to exchange one or more minor pieces
while restricting White's activities on that flank. Nevertheless, it does
represent a long-term weakness that Black may end up paying for.} 20. d4 cxd4

his position at this point. White has two nice central pawns, excellently
coordinated pieces, and pressure down the f-file; whereas Black's pieces are
far more passively placed, he struggles both to find activity and an obvious
plan. Despite my computer only evaluating this as marginally better for White,
he is clearly holding a solid advantage.} Ne7 {To prevent White from playing

his initiative? ANSWER:} 26. g4 $5 {A solid punch in the face for Black, who
might have thought that his earlier ...h7-h5 would have helped prevent this
expansion from happening.} ({Alternatively, White could consider} 26. d5 Kg8
27. Qd4 a5 {and now} 28. Qf6 ({or first} 28. R3f2 {with a clearly better game
in either case. However, the text move is far more complicated for Black to
deal with.})) 26... hxg4 27. hxg4 Bb5 ({EXERCISE: What happens if Black takes
the pawn?   ANSWER: He lands into a load of trouble that he cannot get out of:

Black's queen or mate him.}) 28. Re1 Qd8 29. g5 {Ruthlessly attacking the

realized that the game continuation puts Black under further pressure.}) 29...

White continue? ANSWER:} 30. Bh3 $1 Rcd8 31. Be6 $1 {The threat is 32 Nh5+

the text wins the game after just one more move from each side so it is
difficult to argue efficiency.}) 32... Nxd5 33. Bxd5 {QUESTION: What? I
understand that Black is worse, but resigning seems quite premature. ANSWER:
It may seem premature, but in view of the threat of Rh3 and Qf6+, Black is
completely toast and clearly preferred not to see it through to the end.} ({
Let's take a quick look at what could have happened:} 33. Bxd5 Rd7 {

put a little plug in the holes on the dark squares)} 34. Rh3 Rg8 ({not} 34...

on the next move}) 35. Rh7+ ({the computer prefers to play} 35. e5 {first})

position balanced. However, Black was possibly considering another factor as

An unpretentious move which Vasily Smyslov tried a couple of times. QUESTION:
Doesn't the knight block the f-pawn? ANSWER: In this game White stays away

forces, perhaps hoping to punish Black for his rapid expansion on the
queenside without having developed much else.} b4 9. Nd1 e5 ({As usual Black

it would be completely drawn, but as long as they are on the table, White has
a chance and Black will have to play accurately. Therefore, Adams forces his

like a strange idea; why has White suddenly decided to play on the opposite
side of the board from the action?   ANSWER: Actually, this is the key move in
White's plan. Right now his own bishop doesn't accomplish much on g2; its
ideal post is on d5, where it both attacks the f7-pawn and takes away a lot of
squares from Black's pieces.   QUESTION: Is that enough to win?   ANSWER: As
it turns out, no, it isn't. In fact your own idea of grabbing a pawn was
better, but only with the same plan in mind.} ({First of all, note that after}

purpose of this move? It's not like Black is threatening anything, right?  
ANSWER: The answer to your question lies in the fact that if White plays} 15.
c3 {at once, then} Nxe2+ 16. Qxe2 Bh6 {enables Black to get some minor pieces
off the board. White is still better – the knight on d5 is a beast – but he

EXERCISE: White is clearly better with the pair of bishops and a nice passed
pawn on d5, while Black has no significant counterplay. How should White
proceed? ANSWER:} 20. h4 $1 {It is time to create some additional weaknesses
in Black's position, and the king can easily become very compromised if Black
doesn't immediately take care of the situation.} Nf6 ({I would probably have
opted for the sharper response} 20... f5 21. h5 g5 22. h6 Bf6 {, hoping to
create some counterplay.}) 21. h5 $5 {QUESTION: Can't White just gobble up the
pawn on e5 and be happy? ANSWER: Absolutely! In fact that's also what I would
have played;} ({e.g.} 21. Qxe5 Re8 22. Qg5 Qb6 23. Rhe1 {and Black has very
little in return for the pawn he just lost. White preferred to continue his
assault on the king, deeming that more difficult for Black to deal with.})
21... Nxd5 $6 {This seems like asking for trouble, as Black's king position
will now be holed like a colander. Perhaps he thought the knight would find a
home on f4, from where it could help to defend the king.} ({The alternative}

great care; for example,} f5 24. Rg1 Rf7 25. Bh3 Qxd5 (25... Qd7 26. c4 b6 27.
Be3 Rcf8 {is possibly Black's best set-up, although certainly no guarantee of
a successful defence}) 26. Bxf5 Kf8 27. c4 {looks quite hairy.}) 22. hxg6 fxg6
23. Be4 Qd6 ({Or} 23... Nf4 24. Qg4 Qd6 25. Be3 {, and the defensive role of
the knight on f4 comes to an end whenever White decides it's time.}) 24. Bg3
Rf7 25. Qg4 Rc6 {Guarding g6 and planning to slide the rook to b6 in the hope
of generating some counterplay.} 26. Rd2 Rb6 27. Ka1 {And that's the end of
Black's counter-attack!} Qd7 28. Qh4 Kf8 29. Bf2 Rc6 30. c4 Ne7 ({I would have
tried the more aggressive} 30... Rf4 $5 31. Qh2 Ne7 32. Bg3 Rcf6 {, which at
least gives Black some activity in return for his otherwise miserable position.
}) 31. Be3 $1 {QUESTION: Why is this better than taking on c6? ANSWER:
Objectively speaking, taking the rook is probably just as good, but the text
move does not allow Black any kind of counterplay. He remains stuck in a
passive position with terribly disorganized pieces, whereas White's active,
well-coordinated forces and safer king position are worth far more than a pawn.
} b6 32. Bh6 Re6 33. Bxg7+ Rxg7 34. Rf2+ Ke8 {EXERCISE: How can White make the
most of his superior position? ANSWER:} 35. Bd5 $1 Kd8 ({Not} 35... Nxd5 {
due to} 36. Qh8+ Ke7 37. Qf8# {.}) 36. Qh8+ {White continues in consistent
fashion.} (36. Bxe6 Qxe6 37. Rf6 Qd7 38. Qe4 {is just as convincing, when
Black's position collapses.}) 36... Rg8 37. Rf8+ Rxf8 38. Qxf8+ Kc7 39. Rh7 {
This seals the deal.} ({Seeing as} 39. Rh7 Kd6 {fails to} 40. Qb8+ {etc, Black

QUESTION: It seems as if Black can play this move almost at will without any
preparation; why does Black then play ...Rb8 first in other lines? ANSWER:
That's a good question. Firstly, Black may not want to give up the b-pawn (as
in Game 20), even when it is acceptable to do so. Secondly, the rook is
usually well placed on b8, away from tactics on the long diagonal (as in the
previous game), while helping to carry the queenside attack forward. As it
happens, no one seems to have repeated Stefansson's 7...b5.} ({Apart from

has made the most progress, having gotten quite far on the queenside. Is Black
better here? ANSWER: Not really; the chances are split fairly evenly. White's
attack on the kingside is just about to start, though it is not likely to tear
Black's king shelter apart in a split second. These types of positions require
precise play from both sides. Nigel Short is very experienced in the Closed
Sicilian, as well as the reversed set-up in the English Opening, and he plays
such positions very well. Studying his way of handling them will therefore pay

to keep his a-pawn and then start applying pressure against the weak pawns,
but the situation on the board did not allow that to happen; i.e. with a black
rook coming quickly to the b-file. The result of the previous moves is that
Black's queen is now a little offside, his position is disjointed, and
counterplay is not immediately apparent. I can't imagine that Kasparov was

Anti-Sicilians'. QUESTION: What's the purpose behind this move? Is Black
starting a kingside attack before White has castled? ANSWER: Well, if White
castles kingside and furthermore is a bit careless then, yes, Black can get a
kingside attack going, but that's not the real point of the move. QUESTION: So
what is the point then? ANSWER: Since the standard plan with Bh6 has at least
temporarily – perhaps permanently – been prevented, it is reasonable to
expect White to play f2-f4 instead, and that's when the idea behind ...h7-h5
comes into play: Black can follow up with ...h5-h4 and attack White on the
dark squares. This usually involves inserting ...e7-e5 as well. QUESTION: So
should White play h2-h4 to prevent Black's plan? ANSWER: Preferably not, since
it weakens the g4-square, especially if White follows up with a later f2-f4.}

Nge7 9. f4 ({Deviating from} 9. Nge2 {as in the previous game.}) {QUESTION: If
Black's strategy is to play on the dark squares, doesn't this move help Black
in that regard? I mean, after ...h5-h4, White will be forced to play g3-g4 and
then all the kingside dark squares look weak. ANSWER: You are absolutely right,
it does seem counterintuitive to 'play into' Black's plans. On the other hand,
White has to do something active. Normally 'the rule' is to counter a
premature flank attack with action in the centre, but that is not easily
accomplished; it would require moving the c3-knight to follow up with c2-c3
and d3-d4, and even that wouldn't be terrible productive. Nor can White start
anything relevant on the queenside. Thus he presumably concluded that f2-f4
was the only way to go.} 9... Nd4 10. Nd1 {Now that Black has committed a
knight to d4, White does not hesitate to proceed with the standard eviction
plan, a plan that could include the central pawn break with c2-c3 and d3-d4 we
just mentioned.} (10. Nge2 {is Game 27 again.}) ({In subsequent games, White
has given preference to another knight move:} 10. Nf3 Nxf3+ 11. Bxf3 Be6 ({here

slightly open kingside, D.Viana-E.Barbosa, Mar del Plata 2012}) 12. Ne2 ({

} 12. O-O-O Qa5 13. a3 O-O-O {with roughly equal chances}) 12... Qd7 ({or}

the upper hand.}) 10... h4 {QUESTION: In the previous game when White played
Nd1, Black struck in the centre with ...d6-d5. Can't he do that here too?
ANSWER: Yes, and it actually looks quite promising for Black; but the text is
consistent with his plan of fighting for the dark squares, and he can always
play ...d6-d5 later on.} 11. g4 exf4 12. Bxf4 Ne6 ({QUESTION: Why does Black
chose to retreat his knight from the d4-square? Isn't it perfectly placed?
ANSWER: The text is a continuation of his strategy, threatening to remove
White's dark-squared bishop. However, there is no rush to do this, and White
might yet play c2-c3, so} 12... Nec6 {looks like a good alternative with a
pleasant game for Black.}) 13. Bh2 ({In S.Glinert-J.Fedorowicz, Toronto 2000,
White left the bishop where it was, playing} 13. Ne2 $6 {, after which the
grandmaster surprisingly declined to take it at once, preferring to press in
the centre:} d5 $5 14. Ndc3 $6 {I don't like this move,} ({instead,} 14. O-O d4

clearly on top.}) 13... Be5 $5 {You can run and hide, but I will find you. Now
the bishops come off the board, rendering White's dark squares permanently
vulnerable, which may count in the long term. In the meantime Black is falling
behind in development.} ({Emms suggests} 13... Nc6 14. Nf3 Ned4 {here, though
in that case Black might have played 12...Nec6 at once.}) 14. Nf3 Bxh2 15. Rxh2
d5 16. Nc3 $2 {This is definitely wrong, as it only helps Black execute his
plan.} ({White should seize the opportunity to open the position with} 16. exd5
Nxd5 17. Nc3 ({or} 17. Ne3 Ndf4 18. O-O-O {, when his lead in development and
reasonably well-placed pieces give him the edge.})) 16... d4 $1 17. Ne2 Nc6 {
Although my computer assesses this position as equal, I think Black has the
better chances. The dark squares count in his favour, and his light-squared
bishop is now considerably stronger than its colleague on g2 which is merely
enjoying the view of its own pawns. White's only assets are the half-open
f-file (supposing he can ever get his rooks on it) and the d5-square, so he
sends his knight in that direction straight away.} 18. Nf4 Qd6 19. Nd5 Nc7 $2 {
QUESTION: Why don't you like this move? It seems sensible to remove White's
strong knight. ANSWER: The question is what happens if White just lets it be
taken: after 20...Nxd5 21 exd5, White frees his bishop and gets the open
e-file for a rook. At the moment Black is playing a strategy of containment,
aiming to exploit his superiority on the dark squares when good and ready, and
...Nc7 is inconsistent with this plan.} ({Instead,} 19... Qg3+ 20. Qf2 Bd7 ({or
} 20... Nb4 $5 {looks reasonable.})) 20. Nxc7+ $2 {White seems quite happy to
follow along with his opponent, and I really don't understand why.} ({As just
explained, he should leave the knight where it is and try to utilize his lead
in development after} 20. O-O-O $1 {.} {while after} Be6 ({Taking the pawn is

24. Ng5 O-O-O 25. Bxc6 Qxc6 26. Nxe6 fxe6 27. Qg5 {and White will easily

decides to invite an exchange of queens when it can only be in Black's favour.
If White hopes that the many exchanges will steer the game towards a draw, he
is going to be disappointed.} Qe7 22. Qxe7+ Kxe7 23. Kd2 Be6 24. a3 $6 {
White does seem to be taking the game rather casually.} (24. e5 {was the move
to play here, after which his light-squared bishop comes to life and, more
importantly, the black king is not allowed into e5.}) 24... Kd6 $1 25. Rf1 $6 {
It is getting near now or never time. Despite his suboptimal play so far,
White is not yet really worse, but he needs to find some counterplay quickly
before Black consolidates his grip on the position.} ({To this end} 25. b4 $1 {
suggests itself; e.g.} cxb4 ({or} 25... Rac8 26. e5+ Nxe5 27. bxc5+ Rxc5 28.
Nxd4) 26. axb4 a6 27. Rhh1 {, followed by Rhb1, and White is very much in the
game.}) 25... Ne5 {Incredibly, my computer still gives a smudge of preference
for White, even though the game is clearly heading in Black's favour.} 26. c3 {
It seems that White is finally waking up to the fact that Black will slowly
squeeze the life out of him if he lets him.} Nxf3+ 27. Bxf3 Ke5 $1 {The king
is now in complete control of the events on the board. White has constantly to
worry about the possibility of ...Kf4-g3, and at the same time, Black can
build up an initiative on the queenside.} 28. g5 $5 {White plays another
active move, allowing the exchange of light-squared bishops with Bg4, which
will remove the guardian of Black's f7-pawn. However, if this doesn't work out,
then White has just weakened the kingside further and tied the h2-rook to the
passive defence of a pawn.} Rad8 29. c4 $6 {I don't know what is up with White
in this game: he starts an active plan and then immediately abandons it and
plays passively.} ({He should have continued with} 29. Bg4 Bxg4 30. hxg4 Rh7 {
. It certainly isn't much fun for White, but he looks to have more chances of
holding here than after game continuation.}) 29... b5 $1 {With all of White's
pieces sitting passively on the kingside, Black opens up a second flank on the
queenside. The foundation for this stems from the fact that his king is well
placed on e5, his bishop on e6 equally so, participating on both wings, and
finally the mobility of his rooks. It is quite instructive.} 30. cxb5 ({
White cannot hold the queenside with} 30. b3 {because of} Rb8 $1 31. Bd1 ({or} 
31. Rb1 bxc4 32. dxc4 Bxc4) 31... a5 32. Kc1 a4 {and the defence crumbles.})
30... Rb8 31. a4 a6 $1 {This was the idea behind 29...b5. Allowing the black
rook to capture on b2 is out of the question, so White belatedly has to find a
way to develop some counterplay.} 32. Rc1 $2 ({The last chance was} 32. Bg4
axb5 33. a5 {, trying to keep the queenside closed; e.g.} Ra8 34. Bxe6 fxe6 35.

fighting.}) 32... axb5 33. Rxc5+ Kf4 {With one rook gone from the kingside,
the black king is able to make his entrance on the weak dark squares.} 34. Bg4
$6 {Tantamount to resigning the game;} ({although after} 34. Rf2 Kg3 35. Ke1
Bxh3 36. axb5 Rhc8 {, Black would win for in any case.}) 34... Bxg4 35. hxg4 h3

b7-b6 if there are specific reasons for holding the pawn back; in particular,
if it seems more important to reinforce its colleague on c5. Otherwise,
pushing it pawn all the way forward to b5, initiating queenside counterplay,
is the more logical approach.} ({Here} 11... b6 {seems unnecessarily prudent;

What is the idea behind this provocative-looking move? ANSWER: There are
several ideas. First of all, it lays claim to the g4-square, supporting a
potential ...Bg4. Secondly, the pawn might be pushed further forward to h4 as
and when appropriate. Finally, and not least, it prevents the white queen from
appearing at h5, as occurred in the previous three games. 7...h5!? has scored
quite well for Black, so it certainly deserves some attention.} 8. f5 $6 {

QUESTION: Why would Black decide to give up his extra pawn in this fashion?

patiently sit tight they are inclined to try and break out by giving up
material in order to activate their pieces.} ({Such strategies are sometimes
required, especially if the opponent's initiative might easily build up to

we've seen it several times already, I'm not sure I understand this exchange.
Isn't Black giving up his control of the centre and activating White's pieces?
ANSWER: A very good question! Well, as far as activating the pieces goes:
after the exchange on f4, the bishop on g7 really comes to life and becomes a
major factor. Black doesn't need pawns in the centre to fight for the centre
and, furthermore, the possibility of f4-f5 is ruled out. The pawn exchange is
therefore a typical idea, both in this line and with colours reversed in the

These variations are looking incredibly similar and seem to transpose from one
to another. Is it very important to get the move order exactly right? ANSWER:
In most lines there are a few moves that are similar and which reach
approximately the same positions. What the players must be alert to are subtle
differences where tactical and positional opportunities arise that are not
part of the main flow; for instance, Black throwing in ...c5-c4, ...b4-b3, or
even ...d6-d5, and for White d3-d4 or e4-e5, after which the opponent will not
be able to play routinely. This could be because of an unprotected piece or
some other reason.} Bb7 {Black develops the bishop to its optimum diagonal,
while preparing to seize the a-file with ...Ra8.} ({The fact that c6-knight is
now defended also creates the option of ...c5-c4, which is dubious at this
moment since} 13... c4 $6 14. dxc4 Nxe4 15. Nh4 {uncovers a skewer on the long
light diagonal, and} Na5 16. Bxe4 Bxh3 {does not give Black enough.}) ({
The main alternative is to retreat the f6-knight, uncovering the g7-bishop on
the long dark diagonal and forcing White to defend b2, albeit with slight
drawback of releasing the pressure against the e4-pawn so that ...c5-c4 ceases
to be an option: a)} 13... Ne8 $5 {(setting off on a roundabout manoeuvre to
the d4-square)} 14. Rb1 Nc7 ({surprisingly,} 14... Bd7 15. g4 {would transpose
to Game 24, but obviously d7 is not the best square for the bishop here}) 15.

possible set-ups; and while this version is far from common, it is completely
viable and has a bit of pedigree, since it was once used by Fischer. With 6...

incomprehensible, but it does have a clear purpose: Black is concerned about
the kingside light squares. First of all, White was threatening 14 a3 Na6 15
exf5 gxf5 16 Qd3, which can now be met by ...Ng4. Secondly, he believes that
White will very likely put his knight on e6 and then follow up with g3-g4,

meet in view of Black's cramped pieces. So 13...h5 both defends against

does not always work, and it is even less likely to succeed here as the knight
on e2 is rather in the way. So instead White opens up the b-file, while
eroding the protection for Black's knight on d4. QUESTION: So does that mean
that White is better in this line? ANSWER: No, not at all, but it poses
different problems and takes the game in an entirely different direction than
Black may be used to in the Closed Sicilian.} ({a) White can also prepare the

mostly used to try and tease Black away from a favourite set-up in the open
Sicilian, with White then throwing in d2-d4 after all. The main drawback, if
we intend to stick with the Closed, is that White is committed to playing
lines with the knight on e2, which are not to everybody's taste, even if
Spassky used to play them all the time.}) 2... Nc6 3. g3 g6 4. Bg2 Bg7 5. d3 d6

This is the virtually the same as the main line of Chapter Eight, except that
the white knight is placed less actively on e2. On the plus side, the
g2-bishop remains unobstructed, which means that 9...b5? again runs into 10
e5!, winning material; so Black needs either to secure the c6-knight first or
retreat the other one from f6. The text move is the most popular option; we

best placed? On e2, f3, h3 or somewhere else? ANSWER: It depends on the
position, which sounds like a cop-out but is nevertheless the truth. From the
g3-square, the white knight supports the advance of the kingside pawns and
makes way for its colleague to retreat; on the other hand, it clearly has no

It looks like both sides are making progress, White on the kingside and Black
on the queenside. Which is more dangerous or important? ANSWER: Both are
equally important. With the enemy attack aimed at his king, Black would
obviously prefer to break through on the queenside more quickly, in order to
distract White from his ambitions on the kingside. Obviously if Black's
defences are able to hold their own, he can be more patient on the queenside,
but that is a fine balance to strike. Normally, I would recommend zeroing in
on your target and then attacking with full force as soon as possible.} 18. h5

White be worried? ANSWER: Not especially, since the a-file is not very
significant at the moment. QUESTION: Isn't a2 a penetration square? ANSWER: It
is, but the rook can't achieve much there by itself. If we compare this
position with that in Game 44, say, we can see that White is further forward
on the kingside here, so Black needs first of all to neutralize the enemy
attack.} ({To that end} 19... Nc7 {suggests itself:} 20. Bb2 ({or if} 20. Be3

so which is better: White's space advantage on the kingside or Black's on the
queenside? ANSWER: It is really too early to tell. At the moment, the lines
are still being drawn up for future battle. QUESTION: What about the bishops?
Black's bishops look terribly passive and restrained. ANSWER: It may seem that
way, but it is at most a temporary issue. Black can break the centre open with
...f7-f6 to bring the g7-bishop to life, after which it will be stronger than
its white counterpart. The light-squared bishops, on the other hand, often
balance each other out; if Black plays ...Bb7 and ...d5-d4, they will face off
on the long diagonal.} ({White has of course tried other moves which are less

10. g4 {QUESTION: It seems as if White's attack will touch down before Black
gets anything started on the queenside. Isn't that so? ANSWER: A good start is
half finished, or so I was told when I was younger. Anyway, things are not so
cut and dried. Black's position is solid, he has yet to make any mistakes, nor
is he behind in development; by that reasoning it should not be possible for
Black to be worse. QUESTION: But doesn't White's position look at least a
little more threatening? ANSWER: Not really; g3-g4 is perhaps the beginning of
something, but Black hardly needs to shiver in his boots. If anything, White's
position is a bit loose.} ({Black would play the same way against other moves
too; e.g.} 10. Rb1 Bb7 11. a3 Nf5 12. b4 f6 13. exf6 Bxf6 14. Ne2 Qd6 15. c3 d4

chances to both sides, Be.Larsen-M.Chiburdanidze, Vienna 1993}) ({or} 10. Nb5
f6 {.}) 10... f6 {QUESTION: Oh, I see; Black breaks White's pawns in the
centre to stop the attack, right? ANSWER: In part, yes; but also to activate
his own pieces. Indeed, 9...f6 was quite possible on the previous move.
QUESTION: But how about the pawn on e6? Isn't the backward pawn weak? ANSWER:
Pawns are only weak if they can be attacked. The e6-pawn is safe and if given
the chance, Black may even play ...e6-e5 to open the position even further.}

is doing quite well now; all his pieces are developed and he is putting
pressure on the e6-pawn. Is that a fair assessment? ANSWER: I'm afraid not! In
fact the opposite may be true; Black's pieces are all developed too and, as
you will see, ready to get into action, whereas White's are not generating any
meaningful threats.} Nd4 $1 15. Qd1 Nec6 16. Nxd4 Nxd4 ({Black can also

enemy second rank.}) 20... e5 $5 {QUESTION: Isn't the pawn on d5 hanging?

with check, so it is only a very temporary sacrifice, and the investment is
soon recovered; indeed, White should certainly not take it.} ({Once again}

Black should win sooner or later.}) 25... f3+ 26. Kg3 Qxd3 27. Qb1 {. White
either lost on time or resigned before Black captured the bishop on d2.} 0-1

Nd4 before White has committed a knight to either f3 or e2. Isn't that so?
ANSWER: You're absolutely right. On the other hand, when there is no clear
refutation of a supposedly inferior continuation, you will sometimes see
strong players utilize such lines to muddy the waters early on, in order to
force opponents think for themselves right from the outset. QUESTION: Can't
that be a risky strategy? ANSWER: It depends on how inferior the line is. In
this case, even if White knows the optimal continuation, Black may only be
slightly worse and perhaps not even that, so no major risk is involved.} ({

early to resign? ANSWER: Not really, at least not when the players are both
grandmasters, and White has reached the time control. His powerful knight and
extra pawn on the kingside make the win trivial. At lower levels there might
still be room for mistakes which would allow Black to save himself, but I
think most players would win this as White, even against a strong opponent.}

break you are thinking about would have to be prepared by Qc2 and is not
particular effective right now anyway. As regards the lead in development,

1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. g3 ({As an offbeat try for White, I'd also like to
mention} 3. g4 $5 {. Obviously this is not really a Closed Sicilian, but it is
reasonably close. I will call it the Accelerated Closed Sicilian, because
White hopes to save a move by throwing the pawn two squares forward at once,
rather than having it halt at g3 and perhaps move on later. That being said,
Black does not need to be accommodating and play a line where having the pawn
on g4 actually makes sense. If you want to bring up the argument that early
g2-g4 attacks are in fashion in many openings, these typically only occur when
Black has a knight on f6, which is not the case here. Objectively speaking, 3
g4!? is a fun-looking line, but it is hardly worth pulling it out of the
pocket except for rapid or blitz games. Nevertheless, here are a few
