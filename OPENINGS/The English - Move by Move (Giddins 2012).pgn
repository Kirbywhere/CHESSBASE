1. c4 {. This new series provides an ideal platform to study chess openings.
By continually challenging the reader to answer probing questions throughout
the book, the 'Move by Move' format greatly encourages the learning and
practising of vital skills just as much as the traditional assimilation of
opening knowledge. Carefully selected questions and answers are designed to
keep you actively involved and allow you to monitor your progress as you learn.
This is an excellent way to study any chess opening and at the same time
improve your general chess skills and knowledge. --- The English Opening is a
popular choice, from club level all the way through to world champions. Its
flexibility allows players to choose from a number of different set-ups -
positional or aggressive, classical or hypermodern. It also appeals to those
who prefer learning opening ideas to memorizing reams of theory. In this book,
Steve Giddins invites you to join him in studying the English and its many
variations. He examines instructive games, covers the most important lines and
provides answers to all the key questions.} -- {Steve Giddins is a FIDE Master

{The English Opening,} 1. c4 {, is one of the great chess openings. Named
after the first great English player, Howard Staunton, who was the unofficial
world champion of his day in the 1840s, the English has been used at some time
or other by almost every World Champion. Even Bobby Fischer, who once declared
that 1 e4 was "best by test", resorted to the English several times towards
the end of his career, including twice in his 1972 world championship match
against Boris Spassky. Fischer won both games! Fifteen years later in Seville,
Garry Kasparov relied on the English as his principal weapon as White, in his
world championship match against Anatoly Karpov. Faced with a situation where
he had to win the final, 24th game, to retain his world title, Kasparov again
placed his faith in the English, and duly won. --- Probably the main reason
why the English has proved so popular over the years, with players of such
diverse styles as Botvinnik and Petrosian on the one hand, and Tal and
Kasparov on the other, is its great flexibility. It can be interpreted in many
different ways, ranging from slow, manoeuvring games to slashing kingside
attacks. The great range of possible development plans, for both sides, also
means that the English is much less prone to detailed, move-by-move analysis,
than many forcing openings. This results in less pure "theory", which makes
the opening a useful weapon against weaker players, who cannot simply learn by
rote a forcing sequence, leading to a draw, as they can in some ultra-sharp
openings. The English tends to be an opening where understanding is more
important than theoretical knowledge, and this often makes it a favourite with
more experienced players, who lack the time, energy or inclination to swot up
on sharp theoretical variations, and prefer to lure their opponents into
relatively quiet, strategical positions, where their own greater experience
will turn the battle in their favour.} -- {Many books have been written on the
English Opening, so I should say a word or two about the intentions of this
one. Despite - or perhaps because of - the lack of hard forcing lines, there
is actually a huge wealth of possible variations of the English, since both
sides have great flexibility over how to develop. Some 30 years ago, the
American author John Watson took four volumes to produce a comprehensive
coverage of the English, and much more recently Mihail Marin needed three fat
volumes, totalling almost 1200 pages, even to provide a comprehensive
repertoire for White, based on one specific move-order. So, whatever else it
purports to do, the present volume is not intended to provide a complete
coverage of all English lines. By the same token, nor is it a repertoire book.
The reader will not find a complete, coherent set of recommended lines for
White against each possible black defence. Many such books have been published
before, and I see little sense in trying to rival them. --- Instead, what this
book seeks to do, via a series of deeply-annotated illustrative games, is to
instruct the reader in the main English variations, and the different
structures to which they lead. There is considerable emphasis here on the
middlegame positions which result from the opening. As stated above, the
English is an opening where understanding is more important than concrete
theoretical knowledge, and the would-be English player, particularly at club
and congress level, will win far more points by understanding the positional
and strategic ideas of the opening, than he will by rote-learning of specific
sequences. --- For that reason, I have tried especially hard to select the
most instructive examples of the various lines that I could find. In some
cases, this has involved choosing quite old games, and the reader will find a
few examples even from as far back as the 1960s. Fortunately, the non-critical
nature of many English lines means that such games have not lost their
relevance to the present day, something which could not be said of many
sharper openings, such as the Sicilian or Marshall Gambit. Looking at a 1960s
example of the Poisoned Pawn is about as much use to a present-day Najdorf
player as studying the engine of a 1910 Model T Ford would be to a
contemporary Formula One motor mechanic - it would be of purely historical
interest. In the English, however, classics, such as Smyslov-Liberzon and
Petrosian-Hort in the present volume, will never lose their instructional
value to anybody who aspires to play the white side of the opening.} (1... -- {
Having said that, the book still contains plenty of recent games, and it
presents an overview of the current state of theory in many of the sharper,
more forcing lines. Furthermore, although I have not sought to recommend a
specific repertoire as such, I have added a final chapter on Building a
Repertoire. This discusses the various move-order choices, and suggests
alternative approaches to using the English as White. I hope that this will
enable to reader to draw up a general idea for a repertoire beginning 1 c4,
and to choose between the many different variations. Building a repertoire
with the English is a bit like cooking - whatever a particular chef or his
recipe may say, if you like a certain ingredient, there is no reason not to
add some more of it to your dish. "Season to taste" is the motto - in the
English, one can mix and match a good many different systems and set-ups
according to one's taste, and a player should not be afraid to do so. --- I
myself played the English a great deal during my playing career, and so I have
a lot of experience with many of the lines concerned. It can be used either as
one's main weapon, or as an occasional transpositional tool, against certain
opponents. One can use it to aim for quiet positions or sharp positions, to
occupy the centre with pawns, or to hold back the centre pawns and control the
centre from the flanks. The English is largely a blank canvas on which the
player can create his own artwork, to his own taste. In short, as British
Chancellors of the Exchequer (i.e. Finance Ministers) are wont to say, at the
end of their annual Budget speech, "I commend it to the House!"}) (1... -- {

1. c4 e5 {is the most principled response to the English. White's first move
makes 1...d5 unattractive, but does nothing to prevent the other black centre
pawn advancing two squares, so it is natural for it to seize the opportunity
to do so. However, English advocates can argue that 1...e5 is also a tad
cooperative. As we explain in more detail in the notes to Seirawan-Narciso
Dublan, White's fundamental strategic plan in the English is to attack the
light squares in the centre of the board, and so it can be claimed that 1...e5
weakens those squares a little. Once this move has been played, it will be
considerably harder for Black ever to establish a pawn on d5, and so the
English bishop on g2 is likely to have a strong diagonal, pointing towards the
black queenside. --- Of course, the other point about 1...e5 is that it
produces a Sicilian Defence, with colours reversed and White having a move in
hand. Some people argue that, since the Sicilian is regarded as one of Black's
best defences to 1 e4, and good enough to equalize as Black, then having a
Sicilian as White, with an extra tempo, must give White the advantage. In
reality, this argument is fallacious, for reasons that we explain in more
detail in the notes to Brunello-Brunner. In truth, 1...e5 is a perfectly valid
defence to the English, and should give Black close to equal chances, if
properly handled. Having said that, White players should feel comfortable in
the resulting positions, as they usually represent some of the "purest" forms
of the English that one can get.} 2. -- {The first five games in this section
look at Black playing 1...e5 and 2...Nc6, followed by 3...g6. This kind of
reversed Closed Sicilian produces very typical English structures. In
Seirawan-Narciso Dublan, Smyslov-Liberzon and Petrosian-Hort, we see White
place his pawn on d3, fianchetto his king's bishop, and then employ the
typical English plan of b4-b5, gaining space on the queenside and pressurizing
the light squares. Smyslov-Liberzon and Petrosian-Hort, in particular, are old
classics, and both show how Black's attempts to create counterplay on the
kingside can sometimes rebound on him. --- Miezis-Roemer and Moskalenko-Mestre
Bellido cover the Botvinnik System, which is extremely popular these days. In
this system, White erects the central pawn triangle c4-d3-e4, sacrificing the
d4-square but setting up a position in which he has the flank breaks b4 and f4.
--- Pfleger-Vasiukov, Kasparov-Ivanchuk and Ibragimov-Kuporosov deal with the
classic Four Knights system, in which Black brings his bishop to b4 and
exchanges on c3. These heavyweight structures are some of the richest, and
also most widely-explored English lines, although in recent years they have
lost ground in the popularity stakes, thanks mainly to the increasing use of
the 2 g3 move-order, by which White usually avoids such structures. ---
Taimanov-Hort sees Black adopt the rather rustic plan of putting his bishop on
c5, whilst in Brunello-Brunner we deal with the Reversed Dragon lines, where
Black plays ...d5. --- All of these first ten games see White fianchetto his
king's bishop, but in the last two games of the chapter, we look at
alternative set-ups. Grachev-Lalic deals with Nimzowitsch's 4 e4 line, whilst
Ivanchuk-Karjakin looks at the system with e3. Both are interesting ways to
avoid the most popular and heavily-analysed g3-systems, and in my opinion,
both deserve a closer look.} *

1. c4 {. QUESTION: What is the point of the English? After all, 1 c4 is not
really a developing move, like 1 e4 or 1 d4. --- ANSWER: That is true. The
English is, first and foremost, an attempt to play for control of the central
light squares. White's initial move stakes a claim for the d5-square, and the
follow-up moves, such as Nc3 and g3-Bg2, will further enhance his influence
over the light squares in the centre. It is true that rapid development is
postponed for a while, but the lack of pawn contact in the centre usually
means that lines stay closed early on, so the slight lag in development is
usually not serious.} ({The plan Black adopts in our main game was developed
as White in the Closed Sicilian, by Boris Spassky. One of the classic examples
was the following game, which is worth seeing, not only for its historical
significance in the development of the white strategy, but also as an example
of how dangerous the kingside counterplay can be:} 1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 d6 3. g3 Nc6

1-0 B.Spassky-E.Geller, Candidates, Sukhumi 1968.}) 1... e5 {By no means the
only move, of course, but the most principled. Black seizes the chance to put
a pawn in the centre, although he does fall in with White's plans a little, by
weakening the central light squares. --- QUESTION: 1...e5 produces a reversed
Sicilian, where White has an extra tempo. Shouldn't this be better for White?
--- ANSWER: Not necessarily. Black defences, when played as White with a move
in hand, often do not prove as effective as one might think. Black does not
have to be as ambitious as the White player would be, in the usual lines,
whilst, paradoxically, the extra tempo can often rebound on White, because he
has to commit himself first. We discuss this issue in greater detail in the
notes to Brunello-Brunner.} 2. Nc3 g6 {QUESTION: This looks a bit unusual.} ({
ANSWER: It is, and is probably not that good - White could now respond with 3
d4!. Black would usually reach the variation in the game by starting with} 2...
Nc6 {.}) 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 Nc6 5. Rb1 {QUESTION: This also looks odd. Why
doesn't White develop his kingside? --- ANSWER: It is all part of White's
strategic plan of pressurizing the light squares. He intends to advance b4-b5,
taking control of the square c6, and driving the enemy knight back. White
judges that he can afford to postpone routine development, in favour of
pursuing his strategic plans on the queenside.} ({Having said that, 5 Rb1 is
by no means obligatory. As we will see later, White has other options, such as
} 5. e3) ({and} 5. e4 {.}) 5... d6 6. b4 Nf6 ({
A more aggressive set-up would be} 6... f5 {. As we will see, Black's play in
this game is a little too passive and he postpones his kingside counterplay
too long.}) 7. b5 Ne7 8. d3 O-O 9. Nf3 {Having achieved his queenside space
gain, White starts to catch up in development on the other flank.} ({
Another way of doing so is} 9. e3 {with the idea of Nge2.}) 9... a6 {QUESTION: 
What is this about? Isn't opening lines on the queenside good for White? ---
ANSWER: A very good question! One is usually advised not to move pawns on the
side of the board where one stands worse, and the text breaks that rule.
However, the move is part of a deep strategic idea, introduced by Boris
Spassky, in the equivalent positions arising from the Closed Sicilian. By
exchanging off his a-pawn, Black gets rid of a potential weakness on the
queenside.} ({
He could instead implement his plan at move 11 straightaway, by means of} 9...
h6 10. Nd2 Rb8 11. O-O b6 {
. However, now we see the difference, as White can play} 12. Qa4 {
, when the pawn on a7 is hard to defend.}) 10. a4 axb5 11. axb5 {It should also
be noted that the game position could - and sometimes is - reached if Black
plays an early ...a5, e.g. 5...a5 6 a3 etc, with a pawn swap on b4 rather than
b5.} h6 12. Nd2 {This is a typical move in such positions. White unmasks his
fianchettoed bishop, which exerts pressure down the long diagonal, against the
central light squares and the black queenside. We already see White's standard
English plan in action - his pawn chain b5-c4-d3 controls the central light
squares, and his c3-knight and g2-bishop supplement the pressure on the
squares d5 and e4.} Rb8 13. O-O b6 14. Ra1 Bb7 $6 {QUESTION: What is wrong
with this move? Isn't it logical to exchange White's fianchettoed bishop? ---
ANSWER: Yes and no. Ordinarily, such an exchange would weaken the white king,
but here, it also weakens the central light squares further. These squares are
the main object of White's attack, so exchanging off a key defender of them
plays into White's hands.} ({It would perhaps be better to play} 14... Be6 15.
Ra7 Rc8 {, keeping the bishop.}) 15. Bxb7 Rxb7 16. e3 Nd7 17. Ba3 f5 18. Bb4
Nf6 19. Qf3 {See the note to Black's 14th. The white queen exerts powerful
pressure down the long diagonal. Notice how consistently White pursues the
plan, announced by his very first move - pressure against the central light
squares.} Rb8 20. Ra7 Rc8 {This position illustrates the defensive plan begun
by Black at move 9. He has offloaded his a-pawn, and put his b-pawn on b6. His
only weakness on the queenside is the c7-pawn, and now he places the rook in
position to defend it. The whole plan looks rather passive, but the point is
that the c7-pawn is not that easy for White to attack further - a point so
deep in enemy territory is always easier for the defender to defend, than for
the opponent to attack. Black hopes that he will now have time to create
counterplay on the kingside. --- As mentioned earlier, the plan Black has
adopted here was developed as White in the Closed Sicilian, by Boris Spassky.
See the notes to White's first move. In the present case, Black's problem is
that he is much less well-prepared for a kingside counterattack than was
Spassky in the above game. As a result, Black's position here is much more
passive.} 21. Qg2 {QUESTION: What is the point of this move? --- ANSWER: There
are several ideas. One is to remove the queen from tactical tricks based on ...e5-e4. Another is to free the white f-pawn, which can sometimes advance to f4,
so as to stop Black's kingside pawn advance (especially the thrust ...f5-f4),
and also to intensify the white pressure against the black centre pawns.} h5 {
This looks a little slow.} ({The move} 21... f4 {is more natural, when it
would clearly be suicidal for White to capture twice on f4. Instead, he could
try} 22. Qh3 {(another point of White's last move), with further pressure on
the light squares.}) 22. Rfa1 Bh6 23. Rb7 Qd7 24. Raa7 {White has succeeded in
bringing further pressure to bear on the c7-pawn, but, as we see, it is still
adequately defended.} h4 $2 ({Black should play} 24... Qd8 {, meeting the
tactical threat of Rxb6. White would retain a definite positional advantage,
but it is not obvious how best to increase the pressure. It is not possible to
attack c7 any further, so White should probably continue} 25. Nb3 {with the idea of switching pressure to the centre after d3-d4. Instead, Narciso decides to
jettison material, in order to set his kingside attack going, but this proves
inadequate.}) 25. Rxb6 hxg3 26. hxg3 f4 $2 {This must have been an oversight.}
27. Rxd6 $1 {Whoops! Another pawn goes, and with it, the foundations of
Black's central edifice.} Qg4 28. Rxf6 $1 {Winning even more material.} Rxf6
29. Bxe7 Rf7 30. gxf4 $1 {Not the only way of winning, but a neat method of
disposing of Black's counterplay. White will emerge with a hatful of pawns for
the exchange.} Qxg2+ 31. Kxg2 Rxe7 32. Nd5 Rf7 33. fxe5 Bg5 34. Ne4 {The dominant positions of the two white knights on d5 and e4 are very thematic for the
English, and crown White's central light-square strategy most appropriately.}

1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. g3 g6 4. Bg2 Bg7 5. Rb1 d6 6. b4 a6 {QUESTION: What is
the idea here? --- ANSWER: Black holds up the advance b4-b5, and so maintains
his knight on c6. --- QUESTION: But if Black wanted to do that, why not play 5...a5? --- ANSWER: After 5...a5 6 a3, White would achieve his queenside advance
anyway, and the a-file would be opened. The two lines often transpose, but
here, Black has a slightly more subtle idea in mind.} 7. e3 {QUESTION: How
does this differ from Seirawan's Nf3 plan? --- ANSWER: The plan of e3 and Nge2
has several advantages over Nf3: White keeps open the long diagonal of his
bishop, and is also well prepared to advance f2-f4, so as to hold up the black
kingside attack. --- QUESTION: So is e3 and Nge2 just better than Nf3? ---
ANSWER: Not necessarily, although it is probably more popular in this position.
The main downside of 7 e3 is that it weakens the light squares around the
white king, especially f3, which can become a problem later.} f5 {QUESTION: This looks more logical than Narciso's ...Nf6 plan. --- ANSWER: It is, in that it
pursues the kingside counterplay more actively. However, every pawn move
creates a weakness, and, furthermore, here White is well prepared to advance
f2-f4, to stop the black f-pawn in its tracks. There is an argument that, with
White already committed to e3, Black should hold back the f-pawn and play ...Be6-Qd7, so as to be able to exchange the Bg2. With the light squares round
the white king that much weaker after the move 7 e3, this is quite a logical
plan for Black.} 8. Nge2 Nf6 9. d3 O-O 10. O-O Bd7 $6 {QUESTION: Why don't you
like Black's last move? --- ANSWER: Because it does not fit in with the
prophylactic plan on the queenside, begun by 6...a6.} ({Now that White has
completed his development, he is clearly going to continue with a4 and b5.
Black has a subtle idea here, again developed by Spassky, which starts with} 
10... Rb8 {. --- QUESTION: That looks a funny move! --- ANSWER: Maybe, but it
is based on a subtle tactical point. After} 11. a4 {Black intends to continue}

bxc6 {when the rook on b8 defends the knight on b4!}) 11. a4 $1 Rb8 {
Now Black is too slow, and the text is needed merely to defend the b7-pawn.}
12. b5 axb5 13. axb5 Ne7 14. Ba3 {QUESTION: Seirawan played the same move in
our first game. Does the bishop always go here? --- ANSWER: Not always, but it
is often good. There are threats of c4-c5 or b5-b6, undermining Black's
central pawn structure.} Be6 {An admission that his 10th move was not the best.
If Black were not going to play 10...Rb8, he could at least have put the
bishop on e6 in one move.} 15. Qb3 b6 16. d4 {QUESTION: This is a different
plan from Seirawan's Bb4, Ra1-a7 in the previous game? --- ANSWER: Yes.
Smyslov takes immediate action in the centre, taking advantage of the position
of his knight on e2 (in the previous game, the knight was on d2). Now Black
does not really want to allow dxe5 dxe5, when White would bring a rook to the
open d-file, and the a3-bishop would have a strong diagonal. The next move is
therefore almost forced.} e4 17. d5 $1 {An important follow-up to White's last.
Now his knight will come to d4, eyeing up two tempting entry squares on c6 and
e6. Meanwhile, Black has lost almost all hope of a kingside attack based
around ...f5-f4.} Bf7 18. Nd4 Qd7 19. Bb2 {QUESTION: What is the point of
this? --- ANSWER: The bishop has done its job on the a3-f8 diagonal, and now
that White has pushed his pawn to d5, there is no real hope of a c4-c5 advance.
The bishop now belongs on the long diagonal, whilst the a-file is cleared for
a white rook penetration.} g5 {QUESTION: Is this good? --- ANSWER: Black has
to get some counterplay somehow, but, as we will see, this ends up rebounding,
by weakening his own king's position. This is often the dilemma Black faces in
such positions: if he plays passively, he gives White a free hand; but by
seeking counterplay on the kingside, he runs the risk that the attack will
fizzle out, and then his own kingside weaknesses will return to haunt him. ---
QUESTION: An unfortunate dilemma! --- ANSWER: Indeed, but as Larsen once
observed, "Chess is not an easy game, where you can avoid problems"!} 20. Nce2
{This move covers f4 (preventing the reply 20...f4), as well unmasking the
bishop on the long diagonal. White's ultimate dream would be to bring the
knight to f4 and into e6.} Kh8 21. Ra1 Ng6 22. f4 $1 {QUESTION: I thought
White was attacking on the queenside, so why does he advance on the other
wing? --- ANSWER: Smyslov's play is two-wing strategy of the highest order. On
the one hand, Black was again threatening 22...f4, which White's last move
prevents. Now, if he is to have any chances on the kingside, Black must take
en passant, but then, as we see, his own f5-pawn is a significant weakness -

1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. g3 f5 {This move can presage a cruder set-up, based on ...Nf6 and ...Bc5 (or ...Bb4), similar to the so-called Grand Prix Attack
against the Sicilian. However, on this occasion, it amounts only to a
transposition into the main lines.} 4. Bg2 Nf6 5. d3 g6 6. Rb1 Bg7 7. b4 d6 8.
b5 Nd4 {QUESTION: In Seirawan-Narciso Dublan, we saw the knight retreat to e7.
Is this better? --- ANSWER: It is not necessarily better, but it is a
perfectly valid approach. Black knows his knight cannot stay on d4 forever,
but it will retreat to e6, supporting kingside play.} 9. Nh3 $5 {QUESTION: The
knight looks odd on h3. What is the idea? --- ANSWER: It is a very interesting
choice by Petrosian. Putting the knight on h3 is an idea that sometimes crops
up in the English. White's main idea is to avoid blocking his f-pawn (as would
be the case after Nf3) and to follow up with f4 and Nf2.} ({
The more common alternative is} 9. e3 Ne6 10. Nge2 {when White has the same
set-up as in Smyslov-Liberzon, but the black knight is on e6 rather than e7.})
9... O-O 10. O-O h6 11. f4 Kh7 12. a4 Rb8 13. Nf2 {This is the typical set-up
for White in the Nh3 plan. The advance of the f-pawn not only stops Black from
playing ...f4 himself, but also exerts pressure against Black's pawn centre.
From f2, the knight usefully patrols the g4-square, thus preventing the
potentially embarrassing ...Ng4-e3. As we will soon see, White's play in this
type of set-up is not necessarily confined to the queenside. --- QUESTION: So
if the knight is so good on f2, why is the Nh3 plan not seen more often? ---
ANSWER: Despite its advantages, Nh3 is quite a rare idea in this line. The
three-time British Champion, Harry Golombek, was especially fond of it in
several English lines, but most GMs view it with a degree of scepticism. The
main problem is that by advancing f4, White creates some potentially serious
weaknesses in the centre, notably on the e-file, and must be careful not to
come under pressure in that area. In the right circumstances, however, the
plan with f4 and Nh3-f2 can prove very effective, as it does here.} Bd7 14. Qd2

in typical fashion, but in this instance, he runs into a gorgeous positional

White gone raving mad? --- ANSWER: No, absolutely not! This really striking
move looks potty at first sight, but is actually a superb positional idea. At
a stroke, White seizes control of the light squares in the centre and on the
kingside. We have emphasized already in this book that the main strategical
theme of the English is pressure on the light squares in the centre, but you
will rarely see the plan implemented in such a fashion as this. Obviously, it
takes great positional and tactical ability to see that White will not suffer
for exposing his own king.} fxg4 19. Nxg4 Nef4 {Black launches into a tactical
response, but this comes up short. However, it is hard to know what to
recommend. A major problem is that he finds it hard to connect his rooks,
because the black queen has no good square off the back rank.} (19... Qe7 {

be careful, as his king is exposed and there are opposite-coloured bishops,

1. c4 d6 2. Nc3 e5 3. g3 g6 4. Bg2 Bg7 5. d3 Nc6 6. e4 {QUESTION: Uh? What is
that all about? White blocks his light-squared bishop and weakens d4! ---
ANSWER: Indeed he does, but he obtains other advantages. This is known as the
Botvinnik set-up, although Nimzowitsch pre-dated him with similar ideas.
Although White does block the long diagonal of his light-squared bishop, he
also increases his pressure on the central light squares. As we know, this is
a cornerstone of White's strategy in the English. He intends to follow up with
Nge2 and 0-0. In the middlegame, he will have chances of pawn breaks on both
flanks, with b4 on the queenside and f4 on the king's wing. The Botvinnik has
become extremely popular over the past 20 years, mainly after it was
enthusiastically advocated by English GM Tony Kosten in his ground-breaking
English repertoire book.} Nge7 ({
Black can also adopt a more aggressive set-up with} 6... f5 {
and ...Nf6, which we will examine later.}) ({
Note, however, that blocking the f-pawn with} 6... Nf6 $6 {is questionable, as
it leaves Black vulnerable to a quick run of the white f-pawn. For example,} 7.
Nge2 O-O 8. O-O {and now Black has several tries:} -- (8... Nd4 $6 {is generally not a great move against the Botvinnik System, since it allows White to plug

Black playing his knight to f6 in front of the f-pawn, but delaying castling,
occurred in the game F.Erwich-H.Vetter, German League 2010. This is worth

e4-pawn. --- QUESTION: That looked pretty convincing. What should White do
about this defensive plan? --- ANSWER: Miezis demonstrates the modern approach
in this game, adopting a set-up which counters the Black formation with
doubled rooks on the f-file quite effectively. As a first step, the white rook
protects the c4-pawn, preparing the advance b4.}) 12... Raf8 13. f3 $1 {
This is the key idea. White sets up a solid barrier on the f-file, neutralizing
the enemy rooks. He will follow up with b4 and play on the queenside and in
the centre. --- QUESTION: It looks a bit odd to shut in the "English bishop"
on g2 like this! --- ANSWER: Yes, but this will not last forever. At some
point, White will be able to advance f4, unmasking the bishop. For the time
being, though, he wants to neutralize the enemy rook battery on the f-file, as
well as securely defending his e4-pawn in the event of an exchange of
light-squared bishops after ...Bh3.} Kh8 14. b4 Ng8 15. exf5 $1 {White takes
advantage of the retreat of the knight from e7, to initiate action in the
centre. With the knight on e7, this would have been well met by ...Nxf5, but
now this is impossible, and Black has to make a choice of how to recapture on
f5.} Bxf5 {QUESTION: Is this forced?} ({ANSWER: No. In I.Csom-B.Gulko, Biel

that exchanging light-squared bishops actually favours White, since Black has

phenomenon in Seirawan-Narciso Dublan.} Qd7 21. Nde6 Re8 22. Nxg7 Kxg7 23. Bd4
{QUESTION: Things seems to have gone wrong for Black. --- ANSWER: Yes, he has
been completely outplayed, and it is obvious that White has secured a clear
positional advantage. Black has weaknesses on the central light squares, and
his king is very exposed.} Kf8 24. Kg2 Qf5 25. Rc3 ({The energetic} 25. c5 $1 {

Grachev-Lalic and Ivanchuk-Karjakin.} Bb4 5. Bg2 O-O 6. O-O Bxc3 {As noted in
the chapter's introduction, this variation with the exchange on c3 nowadays
arises relatively rarely, because most white players use the early g3
move-order, where the knight jumps to d5 the moment the black bishop comes to
b4. However, these positions after ...Bxc3 remain extremely rich and full of
interest.} 7. bxc3 {QUESTION: Is the other recapture possible? --- ANSWER: Yes,
it is. The choice between the two recaptures is a difficult one, but there is
one rule of thumb which can be offered. This is as follows: if the black pawn
has already advanced to e4, then recapturing with the d-pawn is more likely to
be promising for White. This is because he has use of the square d4, and can
manoeuvre his pieces more effectively. We will examine such positions in
Ibragimov-Kuporosov. With the black pawn not yet committed to e4, as here,
White more usually recaptures towards the centre.} d6 ({
QUESTION: From what you have just said, isn't} 7... e4 {logical here? ---
ANSWER: Absolutely, and it is the main line. We will examine this in the next
game.}) 8. d3 h6 $6 ({Once again, Black should prefer} 8... e4 {.}) 9. e4 {
QUESTION: Yet another Botvinnik formation! --- ANSWER: Sort of. Now White has
established the pawn structure he is looking for. With his pawn on c3, this
type of Botvinnik formation makes particular sense, since the doubled c3-pawn
protects d4. White intends to move his knight from f3 and push the f-pawn,
gaining space on the kingside.} a6 10. a4 b6 (10... Rb8 {was suggested by
Ljubojevic, with the idea of creating counterplay by ...b5. Black needs to

does not.}) 11. Nh4 Bg4 12. Qe1 Na5 13. Ra3 {QUESTION: That looks funny!} ({
ANSWER: It is a bit clumsy, but White wishes to protect the b3-square whilst
at the same time maintaining the guard on his a-pawn, which would not be the

1. c4 Nf6 {This move-order is quite a common way to reach the ...e5 set-ups.
Of course, it does allow 2 Nf3, preventing 2...e5, but then we reach a
position more often arrived via the Reti move-order 1 Nf3 Nf6 2 c4. These
English/Reti lines are very amorphous and such transpositions frequently arise.
} 2. Nc3 e5 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. g3 Bb4 5. Bg2 O-O 6. O-O e4 {QUESTION: In the last
game, Black exchanged on c3 here. Is the text better? --- ANSWER: The
move-orders involving ...Bxc3, ...e4 and various preliminary moves (...d6, ...Re8, etc) are all pretty amorphous and hard to get a real grip on. However, it
does seem to me that it makes more sense for Black to take on c3 first. As we
have discussed, whether White takes with the b- or d-pawn is influenced partly
by the position of the black e-pawn, so it seems logical to exchange on c3
before committing the e-pawn. Then Black can decide whether to advance ...e4
or not, depending on which way White recaptures.} 7. Ng5 {
QUESTION: Is this the only move?} ({ANSWER: No,} 7. Ne1 {
is a major alternative, and will be examined in the next game.}) 7... Bxc3 8.
bxc3 {QUESTION: Err, hang on! I thought you said White usually prefers to take
with the d-pawn if Black has already played ...e4? --- ANSWER: Yes, I did. But
that is only when White's knight is ready to transfer to the e3-square. If he
had retreated his knight to e1 last move, then 8 dxc3 would make sense,
intending Nc2-e3. But here the knight on g5 is a long way from e3, so that
plan is not really available. Instead, White intends a much more dynamic
approach.} Re8 9. f3 (9. d3 {is also possible, but is rather tamer. After} exd3
10. exd3 d6 {White does not really have anything much.}) 9... exf3 $6 (9... e3
$1 {is possibly the best move here. --- QUESTION: Doesn't this lose a pawn?
--- ANSWER: Yes, but this pawn sacrifice, originally introduced by Karpov, is
almost certainly Black's best option here. Black recognizes that he cannot
stop White obtaining a central pawn majority, so he tries to ensure that its
value is diminished as far as possible, even at the cost of a pawn sacrifice.}

14. f4 {. --- QUESTION: Looks like a total mess! --- ANSWER: That is not an
unfair description. The position is very difficult and unclear. However, if we
bear in mind White's strategic objectives, we can see the logic of his play.
He has kept his pawn structure intact and still has his bishop pair. The pawn
on e3 is a bone in his throat, but if he ever succeeds in disgorging it, he
will have a huge central pawn phalanx. Meanwhile, he has open lines for his
pieces. Black needs to keep the e-pawn, and harass White, in an attempt to
prevent him regrouping successfully and laying siege to e3. Some lines:} -- (

dxc3 {QUESTION: At last, someone has played what you said they should play!
--- ANSWER: "Everything comes to he who waits"! But this is the sort of
structure where taking with the d-pawn makes most sense. --- QUESTION: So why
is that? --- ANSWER: As we have said before, the position of the black e-pawn
on e4 changes a few things. Firstly, White has control of the square d4.
Secondly, he can use d5 as a knight outpost, since, with the d-file opened,
chasing the knight away by means of ...c7-c6 would risk leaving a weakness on
d6. Thirdly, the black e-pawn can be attacked. And, finally, the advance f2-f4
will potentially place Black in a quandary. If he ignores it, White can follow
up with h3 and g4, gaining a serious amount of kingside space. On the other
hand, if Black takes on f3, en passant, then the game is opened up for White's
bishop pair, especially the English bishop on g2. --- QUESTION: You paint a
very rosy picture! If it is so good for White, why doesn't he always play this
way? --- ANSWER: I am not saying it is clearly good for White, but he
certainly has a position where he has promising chances and Black is usually
fighting to maintain the balance. Quite often, White reaches an ending with
the bishop pair, where Black faces an unpleasant fight for a draw. As to why
White doesn't play this way more often, the main reason is that he usually
doesn't get the chance! As we have said, if Black times the moves ...Bxc3 and ...e5-e4 carefully, he can usually prevent White reaching the set-up seen in
this game.} h6 {This is an important move. Allowing the exchange Bg5xf6 would
weaken the e4-pawn further and allow White to station his knight on e3 without
blocking in the bishop.} 9. Nc2 Re8 10. Ne3 {This is the typical post for the
knight in this line. From e3, it blockades Black's e-pawn and prepares a
potential jump to d5.} d6 11. Qc2 Qe7 {QUESTION: Does Black have other ways to
play? --- ANSWER: He certainly has some flexibility in exactly where to place
his pieces, but in most cases it will not greatly change the fundamentals of
the position.} ({For example,} 11... Bd7 12. Bd2 a5 13. Rae1 a4 14. f4 exf3 15.

space-gaining advance with g4. Indeed, annotating the present game in
'ChessBase Magazine', the strong Hungarian GM Zoltan Ribli described 12...exf3
as "practically forced".}) 13. exf3 {QUESTION: Even so, this does not look all
that impressive for White. He has doubled pawns and his bishops don't look all
that wonderful. --- ANSWER: Maybe not, but "He who has the bishops has the
future". The doubled pawn is not really weak, and controls a lot of central
squares. If nothing else presents itself, then in such positions, White can
usually just exchange the heavy pieces on the e-file and play for a minor
piece ending, where he has the bishop pair. --- QUESTION: The bishops don't
look all that fearsome right now. --- ANSWER: No, but White's position has
potential. For example, one possible scenario is to play Nd5, and after ...Nxd5, recapture cxd5. Then after a subsequent c3-c4, the dark-squared bishop
has a great long black diagonal a1-h8.} Qe5 14. Bd2 a5 15. Rae1 Qc5 16. Kh1 Be6

natural. Why do you give it a "!?" label? --- ANSWER: The problem is that
Black has a tactical trick in response, with the gambit 5...d5 (see next note).

a3 {. Then} d6 6. e3 {would transpose into the game, whilst after other fifth
moves by Black, White will continue in similar fashion, with e3, Ne2, etc.
This strikes me as perfectly valid. Since the expansion a3-b4 is part of
White's plan anyway, 5 a3 should not really be considered a loss of tempo.}) ({
Having said that, Mihail Marin is of the opinion that 5 a3 is something of a
tempo loss, and argues that "Logically, White cannot hope for an opening
advantage". He therefore recommends that White either plays 5 e3, as in the
main game, or else continues} 5. Nf3 {. --- QUESTION: But I thought you said
White wants to play e3 and Nge2? --- ANSWER: Ideally, he does, but in view of
these issues surrounding whether he needs to spend a tempo preparing e3 with 5
a3, Marin prefers to amend the plan somewhat. White still intends to play e3
at a later stage, but first, he completes his development with 0-0 and d3. ---
QUESTION: Looking at the position after 5 Nf3, haven't we transposed into a
Four Knights variation? --- ANSWER: Indeed, which is another reason why the 5
Nf3 plan is important. See too the note to White's 3rd move above. After 5 Nf3,
play might go} O-O 6. O-O d6 7. d3 h6 8. a3 a5 9. e3 {. White will follow up
with b3, Bb2 and then d4, with typical play against the excluded bishop on c5.

7. b4 Bb6 8. d3 {QUESTION: Black seems to have stopped the plan of d4, so he
must be doing well, right? --- ANSWER: Not necessarily. It is true that the
advance d4 has been stopped for the time being, but White has acquired other
trumps. He has blunted the g1-a7 diagonal, and gained space on the queenside.
Even if White never plays d4, there is already a danger that the bishop will
find itself out of play on b6. White can also play to exchange it off with
Na4xb6, unless Black spends a tempo playing ...a6.} Qd7 9. h3 $1 {White prevents the exchange of light-squared bishops on h3. With the formation involving
pawns on g3 and e3, this is especially important, since the light squares
around the white king would be especially weak after the exchange of the

castle, because his h3-pawn would hang? --- ANSWER: That is true, but White
will deal with that issue by expanding on the kingside with g4 later on.} O-O

the nuances of the various move-order choices in the final chapter.}) 3... d5
4. cxd5 Nxd5 {QUESTION: This looks like an Accelerated Dragon Sicilian, with
colours reversed and an extra tempo for White! --- ANSWER: On this occasion,
looks are not deceptive! That is just what it is. --- QUESTION: Well, surely
that should be better for White, shouldn't it? --- ANSWER: Not necessarily. It
is a common phenomenon in chess, that black openings played as White, with an
extra tempo, fail to offer the kind of advantage that one might at first sight
expect. I discussed this issue more deeply in my book 'How to Build your Chess
Opening Repertoire', but briefly, the main problem is that having an extra
move also means having to commit oneself earlier. Black defences often rely
for their effectiveness on the fact that White must first make a commitment,
and Black can then react appropriately. Once you give the black position an
extra tempo, the boot is on the other foot - in using that extra tempo, he
commits himself, and the black player (playing what is usually the white
position!) can then select a line of play where the extra tempo is less
effective.} 5. Bg2 Nb6 {QUESTION: Is this forced?} ({
ANSWER: Not quite forced, but the defence of the knight by} 5... Be6 {
is regarded as inferior, because White can strike in the centre with d4, e.g.}

Nf3 ({In the 3 g3 move-order, White does have the additional option here of} 6.
Nh3 {. --- QUESTION: Why would White do that? --- ANSWER: We saw in
Petrosian-Hort that the knight has its points on this square. The long
diagonal of the English bishop is kept open, and White intends to strike the
enemy centre with the advance f2-f4. This has never been a very popular plan,
but it was a favourite of Harry Golombek, who won many games with it. ---
QUESTION: So what is the drawback? --- ANSWER: The problem is that the advance
f2-f4 potentially creates weaknesses down the e-file. The two white centre
pawns on d3 and e2 can come under pressure later in the game. We see a similar
situation (albeit from a different variation) in Kosten-Coenen - the f4-plan
is quite a dynamic option for White and can produce a dangerous initiative on
the kingside, but if that does not yield anything concrete, White can
subsequently regret the weaknesses created. --- An example of the move 6 Nh3
is the following:} Nc6 7. d3 Bf5 (7... Be7 8. O-O O-O 9. f4 Bxh3 $6 10. Bxh3

"White remains full of holes, wherever he puts his [central] pawns, yet his
pieces are active". In W.Uhlmann-A.Dckstein, Munich 1958, White went on to
win in powerful style. In general, this line may appeal to more dynamic
English players, but it should be noted that it is only open to White if he
has not committed his king's knight to f3 early on.}) 6... Nc6 7. O-O Be7 8. a3

) 8... O-O ({QUESTION: What about} 8... a5 {here, preventing White from
expanding on the queenside? --- ANSWER: This is playable, of course, but it

excellent illustration of Yasser Seirawan's maxim for attacking play,

every one except his king) are taking part in the attack. A brilliant
exploitation of several typical themes for such structures, particularly the
pressure on the c-file and dominance of the light squares.}) 9. b4 Be6 10. Rb1

is the main point of delaying d3. White also hopes that the rook will be
useful on the b-file, perhaps after a later Ne4-c5, when an exchange on c5
will leave the rook attacking b7.} f6 {Another point of White's early
queenside expansion is to force this move, to defend the e5-pawn. Black is
thus prevented from adopting the more aggressive set-up with ...f5, as White
would usually do in the equivalent Dragon lines, with colours reversed. This
is one example where the extra tempo White enjoys here makes it presence felt,
but, on the other hand, Black is usually happier to adopt a solid, equalizing
approach than White would be with colours reversed.} 11. d3 a5 {

1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 e5 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. e4 {QUESTION: Aha, another Botvinnik
Variation? --- ANSWER: Well, more like the Dr McCoy Variation - "It's the
Botvinnik, Jim, but not as we know it"! The move was actually invented by
Nimzowitsch, and is named after him. The big difference here is that White's
knight is committed to f3. In the Botvinnik proper, the knight almost always
goes to e2. --- QUESTION: So is this version better or worse? --- ANSWER: In
general, it has always been assumed to be worse, because White's f-pawn is
obstructed, and the advance f2-f4 is an integral part of White's plans in the
Botvinnik. Largely for that reason, the Nimzowitsch Variation has always been
assumed to be fairly harmless and has never been all that popular at GM level.
However, in recent years, it has attracted a few more grandmaster supporters,
notably the Chinese star, Bu Xiangzhi, and the English GM, Tony Kosten, who
advocated it enthusiastically in 'Dangerous Weapons: Flank Openings'. ---
QUESTION: Why is that? --- ANSWER: Well, 4 e4 does have several plusses. In
the first place, Black is deprived of the chance to break in the centre with ...d5. Secondly, the move fulfils the basic strategic aim of the English, namely
controlling the light squares in the centre. If Black does not stop him, White
will follow with d4, securing control of the centre. If this is prevented,
White plays d3, g3, Bg2 and 0-0, and will then look to move his knight from f3
and push the f-pawn. He can develop quite a strong initiative, if Black is not
careful.} Bc5 {QUESTION: What other moves are possible here? --- ANSWER: The

Variation is that White has to live with the d4 weakness. Yes, it is a nice
square for Black, but it is important to remember that it is only one square -
there are 63 others on the board, and White intends to cause Black trouble on
some of those! Another point is that Black actually has several pieces that
would like to occupy d4 - in this position, for example, all three of his
minor pieces would like to be there. But only one can ever occupy the square
at any one time, so the other two often find themselves struggling for a good
post. Mark Dvoretsky has written instructively about this positional idea of
"the superfluous piece", and in view of its relevance in the Botvinnik and
Nimzowitsch systems of the English, it would be worth the reader checking out
his work.}) (7... Nd4 {

is another completely different approach from that introduced by 4 g3. Rather
than fianchettoing the king's bishop, White prepares to play in the centre. In
many lines, he will advance d4, whilst if Black plays an early ...d5, we will
usually reach some kind of Scheveningen/Taimanov Sicilian structure, with
colours reversed. The line was popular during the 1970s, but lost ground after
the Timman-Karpov game (see below). In recent years, the growth of the "Kosten
approach" based on 2 g3 (see Chapter 6) has seen interest in the 4 e3 system
wane, but it is still seen occasionally, and in my opinion, is a refreshing

White should not be frightened into abandoning 4 e3 altogether; rather, he
should react to 4...Be7 by adopting a slower, Taimanov/Scheveningen-style
set-up, with colours reversed. Although the extra tempo does not promise any
real advantage (largely for the reasons outlined at the beginning of Brunello-Brunner), such an approach leads to a tense position, with plenty of pieces on

nature of the pawn position favours the bishops, since with play on both sides,
the longer-range bishops tend to come into their own. Objectively, White has
only a small advantage, but in practice, his is a pleasant position to play.
At a high level, White has relatively few losing chances, and it is just a
question of whether Black can play well enough to hold half a point - not a
very nice prospect for the black player. The rest of the game is not strictly
within the province of a book on the English Opening, so I append only very
brief comments. I have analysed this endgame in more detail in my book '101

at some point Black will be forced to break it. He has various ways to do so.
--- In Grischuk-Bocharov, he maintains the symmetry for as long as possible,
until White's central advance d4 forces an end to it. The result is a kind of
Maroczy Bind structure, where White has a small advantage. Jobava-Pogorelov
sees Black adopt an asymmetrical formation, with the moves ...e6 and ...Nge7.
This line was a favourite of Bobby Fischer, who defeated both Smyslov and
Petrosian with it, and until recently it was regarded as one of Black's best
lines. However, the latest wrinkles seem to give White a promising position,
and the line is currently under a slight theoretical cloud. ---
Andersson-Seirawan is another Botvinnik formation, but this time it is Black
who adopts that set-up, placing pawns on c5 and e5. In our featured game, Ulf
Andersson wins a subtle and instructive effort as White. Finally, in
Kosten-Coenen, we see Black adopt the Rubinstein System, with an early ...d5.
This produces another Maroczy-type structure, but this time it is Black who
establishes the bind, and White who fights against it.} 2. -- {The fact that
we should see the same formations occurring with both colours is a testament
to the flexibility of the English Opening. One of the great difficulties of
the opening is that it can lead to numerous different formations, and the
abundance of transpositions makes it very difficult to pin the opening down to
traditional "theoretical variations". However, these qualities are also what
make the English such a great opening, and mean that it is the ideal weapon
for a player who wishes to engage his opponent in a battle where understanding
of positions matters more than rote learning of variations.} *

Nd2 {, when he will try to exploit the offside position of the a5-knight.})) 8.
Nxd4 Nxd4 9. Qxd4 d6 {QUESTION: So what is going on here? --- ANSWER:
Basically, we have a form of Maroczy Bind structure. White will usually play
e4, setting up the familiar structure, when he enjoys a space advantage. Black
will look for counterplay with the thrust ...b5, and occasionally, ...f5. One
point to note here is that a pair of knights has been exchanged. This slightly
eases the cramp that Black usually suffers in such positions. QUESTION: What
are the main ideas for White? --- ANSWER: He has several. He normally plays b3,
puts his bishop on either b2, d2 or e3, and centralizes his rooks on c1 and d1.
Then various strategic ideas come into play: -- 1. Using the d5 outpost. When
the knight comes here, it exerts unpleasant pressure on Black's game. If it is
taken, then White can either take with the e-pawn, trying to pressurize the
backward e7-pawn, or with the c-pawn, hoping to exploit the open c-file to
penetrate Black's position. -- 2. The exchange of dark-squared bishops may
produce weaknesses on the black kingside. -- 3. The pawn breaks c5 and e5, if
they can be achieved in favourable circumstances, can break up the black
structure. -- 4. The advance f4, followed by f5, with the idea of a kingside
attack. --- Black's ideas mainly revolve around trying to break with ...b5.
The manoeuvre ...Qa5-h5 sometimes occurs, although if Black's does not
generate kingside counterplay this way, the queen can find herself out of play.
The other pawn break is ...f5, which can also be effective if correctly timed,
but this break also creates serious weaknesses down the e-file and on the
light squares in the centre, so Black must be careful about playing this.} 10.
Qd3 {QUESTION: What is the point of this move? --- ANSWER: White removes his
queen from the long diagonal, whilst at the same time keeping his c4-pawn
protected. The latter is a frequent target for Black counterplay in these
positions, since from g2 the white bishop does not defend this pawn. Black
will frequently play ...Be6, which attacks c4, and also (if the white queen is
still on d4) sets up the unpleasant threat of ...Nd5; hence the queen retreat.}
a6 {This is a major branching of the ways, with Black having a number of
playable alternatives; we will look at the two most common:} (10... Nd7 {
. --- QUESTION: Idea? --- ANSWER: The knight transfers to c5, incidentally
gaining another tempo on the white queen. The knight stands quite well on that
square, and the black bishop on g7 is unmasked:} 11. b3 Nc5 ({

10... Bf5 11. e4 Be6 {. --- QUESTION: This is a bit bizarre, isn't it? Why
lose a tempo to provoke e4, a move which White wants to play anyway? ---
ANSWER: He does want to play it in the medium term, yes, but in the early
stages, he often holds it back. By keeping the long diagonal open, White makes
it harder to Black to develop his queenside, because of the pressure against
b7. Black therefore takes radical measures and forces an immediate e4, so he
can develop freely. --- In response, 12 b3 is nowadays the general preference.}

securely so. The knight can potentially be exchanged off by a subsequent ...Nd4.} 16. Qb1 Ra6 17. Rb6 Qc7 18. Rb2 b6 19. Bd2 {QUESTION: What is this for?

makes a positional sacrifice of rook for knight. He gets one pawn immediately,

positional exchange sacrifices have always been a feature of Andersson's play.}

He has one pawn, as I say, and his minor pieces have some good squares - b5,
d5, etc. The black pawns on b6 and d6 are weak, and the English bishop has a
lovely diagonal. --- QUESTION: So is White better? --- ANSWER: Maybe not much
better objectively, but he has full value for a small material investment, and
his position is rather easier to play in practice.} Rd8 25. Qb3 {Putting another guard on d5. He does not want to let Black get in the advance ...d6-d5.} Kh8

Re-establishing the knight in striking distance of d5, whilst at the same time

QUESTION: What is that for? --- ANSWER: It is a rather typical Andersson move,
actually. Black cannot undertake anything, so he just improves his position.
His king gets a bolthole on h2 (you never know...) and there is also the
possibility that a later h5 will undermine the kingside light squares.} ({

QUESTION: We have a reversed Maroczy Bind, right? --- ANSWER: Indeed, and most
of the plans for White are taken from Black's play in the equivalent position
in the Maroczy proper. In particular, the pawn breaks b4 and f4 are both
highly thematic. The former is the harder to achieve, and consequently, one
more often sees White break with f4. However, the extra tempo does give White
one or two more dynamic options that are not available to Black in the normal
lines.} 8. Ne1 {
This is one of three main plans, each of which we will examine here.} ({
One thing White must avoid is the kind of planless, aimless woodshifting, seen
in the games of Rubinstein's and Botvinnik's opponents. One characteristic
example is the following:} 8. b3 Be7 9. Bb2 O-O 10. Rc1 {

d3 Be7 9. Nd2 Bd7 10. Nc4 {was the old main line.} -- ({. White was considered
to have some advantage, since after the apparently forced} 10... f6 {
, he can continue} 11. f4 {with good play.}) ({. QUESTION: This all looks very
natural. However, I sense that a "but" is on the way... --- ANSWER: I am
afraid so! Enthusiasm for the white position here diminished sharply in the
1970s, by the discovery that Black has good compensation after the pawn
sacrifice} 10... O-O $1 11. Bxc6 Bxc6 12. Nxe5 Be8 {. Although it looks
unimpressive at the moment, the bishop on e8 can jump out later, either to c6
or h5, and White's position is hard to activate, because his central pawns
cannot really become mobile and his rooks have no scope. When players of the
calibre of Petrosian started coming a cropper on the white side of this
position, people began to look for other ways to play as White. A typical
1970s example was K.Commons-F.Gheorghiu, Lone Pine 1975:} 13. Qb3 b6 14. Be3

Marin, and recently adopted successfully by both Kramnik and Svidler. ---
QUESTION: What is the point? It doesn't look as though White will be able to
prepare b4. --- ANSWER: This is one reversed Sicilian line where the extra
tempo comes in useful. White is able to use it to exploit some tactical
opportunities that would not be available to Black in the normal line. ---

cannot castle unless he exchanges queens, and in the ending White will stand
better, because he has one pawn island against three. --- QUESTION: Don't the
opposite-coloured bishops make it drawish? --- ANSWER: Not really, because
there are plenty of other pieces on the board. Opposite bishops only really
become a serious drawing factor when they are almost the only pieces remaining.

why? After all, you have previously assessed positions as better for White
because he had fewer pawn islands than Black; here, it is Black who has two
pawns islands against three. --- ANSWER: It is a question of dynamics vs.
statics. Statically, Black is better, because he has the superior pawn
structure. If he could remove the queens from the board, and maybe a couple of
pairs of minor pieces as well, he would have good prospects of being able to
exert pressure down the d- and e-files, against the white central pawns. But
once we take dynamic factors into account, the picture is much less rosy for
Black. White's pieces are all very actively placed, and Black has weaknesses
on the central light squares, such as d5 and e6. White will follow up with e3,
bring the queen to a very aggressive position on h5, and centralize his rooks.
On a good day, he can stick a rook on d1 and start pushing the d-pawn down the
board. All of this gives him prospects of a very dangerous initiative.} Kh8 ({

very respectable system for Black, but White has a number of options against

{The Mikenas System is one of the nearest things to a traditional,
variation-based English line. It arises after the moves} 1. c4 Nf6 2. Nc3 e6 3.
e4 {. QUESTION: What is this, another type of Botvinnik System? --- ANSWER:
Not really. With this line, White abandons the traditional, hypermodern
approach to the centre, characterized by the flank observation of the central
light squares, with such traditional English moves as g3, Bg2, d3, etc. In the
Mikenas, White adopts a much more classical, "in-your-face" approach,
occupying the centre with pawns, and threatening to drive back the enemy
pieces with moves such as e5. It is an altogether more dynamic approach to the
English Opening. --- Black has only two reputable options at move three. In
Kharlov-Ospennikov, he plays 3...c5, but, as we shall see, against this White
has a dangerous positional pawn sacrifice at his disposal. In the resulting
positions, even with queens exchanged, White can frequently establish a
ferocious bind on the dark squares, and Black's play can be extremely
difficult. --- In Aronian-Kramnik, Kramnik prefers 3...d5, which is certainly
the safest and most solid defence. However, even here, there are many sharp
lines and plenty of ways for Black to go wrong. The main line leads to a
position where White has only a small edge, but the fact that so fine a
defender as Kramnik was unable to hold the black position shows that the
latter's difficulties should not be underestimated. --- All in all, the
Mikenas has always struck me as a pretty attractive system for White. Its only
real drawback is that it can only be reached by one, specific move-order, and
relatively few black players allow it, but if given the chance as White, I
would always grab it.} *

White has a little more space and is ahead in development. However, Black's
position is rock-solid, and he has one fewer pawn island than White, so he may
potentially have some long-term endgame chances. One interesting feature is
that the pawn structure is basically the same as that which arises in the main
line of the Petroff, or Russian Defence, after 1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nf6 3 Nxe5 d6 4

White has a small advantage, but Black's game is pretty solid. It is rather

1. c4 {. In this chapter, we look at lines where Black tries to force some
sort of Slav or Queen's Gambit Declined (QGD) structure. In both cases, White
could of course transpose into those very lines, but we are assuming that he
prefers to keep independent, English contours to the game. --- Timman-Ernst
shows our recommended anti-Slav set-up. White leaves his d-pawn untouched and
just develops his kingside in traditional English style, with Nf3, g3 and Bg2.
Black then has a variety of ways to play, including grabbing the gambit pawn
on c4. In all cases, White gets very good play, with several of the most
natural "Slav" moves, such as an early ...Bf5 or ...Bg4, liable to run into
some nasty tricks. --- McDonald-Nicholson and Miles-Geller show a set-up for
White against the traditional QGD approach, where Black plays ...e6 and ...d5.
White again holds back his d-pawn, and plays a double fianchetto system. This
retains a great deal of tension in the position, by avoiding mass early
exchanges, and this makes the line very suitable for playing for a win as
White. Contrary to popular belief, the best way to win "to order" is often to
eschew a violent tactical battle, where the position is liable to fizzle out
after a brief flare-up, and instead to play a more restrained game,
maintaining the tension for as long as possible, so as to prolong the
defender's agony. The classic illustration of this was Game 24 of the
Kasparov-Karpov world championship match at Seville, 1987, in which Kasparov
did precisely this, using the very double fianchetto system we recommend in
this chapter.} -- {Black has two main ways to deal with this system. In
McDonald-Nicholson, he exchanges pawns on c4, producing an asymmetrical
structure, where White has a central pawn majority and Black a majority on the
kingside. White can then choose between a restrained approach, with d3 and a
kingside pawn advance, or a more classical central strategy, pushing d4 and d5.
Both methods are examined in McDonald-Nicholson, the first in the main game
itself, and the second in the notes. --- Miles-Geller shows Black's other
approach, which is to push ...d5-d4. This results in yet another structural
change, and yet another reversed opening structure, this time a Modern Benoni
with colours reversed. --- Finally, in Carlsen-Gashimov, we examine the black
system known as the Hedgehog. This is quite a popular way for Black to play
against the English. We will consider two systems for White, both of which
offer interesting play and the prospect of a small, but stable plus.} *

play, but where he is suffering a bit, and has few winning prospects, in the
absence of a blunder from White. --- QUESTION: So it's another of your

this line.}))) ({Now, back to the position after} 4... dxc4 {. --- QUESTION:
Hold on! Haven't we lost a pawn here? --- ANSWER: We have gambited one, yes!
--- QUESTION: So what do we have by way of compensation? After all, developing
with g3, Bg2, etc. is not typical gambit play - it is hardly an open position,
is it? --- ANSWER: That is true. White's gambit is for long-term positional
pressure. He has lured the black d-pawn away from the centre, thereby securing
a central pawn majority. If he can eliminate the c4-pawn, White will have the
possibility of playing d4 and e4, occupying the centre. In addition, by
attacking the c4-pawn, he hopes to induce some weaknesses from Black on the
queenside (e.g. the move ...b7-b5), when he will have targets to attack, both
on the b- and c-files, and also down the h1-a8 diagonal. Similar sacrifices
are common in the Catalan; here, the difference is that White's pawn is on d2,
rather than d4. --- QUESTION: And what happens if Black hangs on to the
c4-pawn? Won't that plug up the c-file as well? --- ANSWER: In that case,
White will usually force the exchange by playing b2-b3. That will make the
pawn sacrifice permanent, but remove the c4-pawn and open the c-file. He will
then aim to use the open queenside files to exert pressure, slightly
reminiscent of the Benko Gambit.}) 5. O-O ({
White can also delay this move and play} 5. Qc2 {immediately. --- QUESTION:
What difference does it make? --- ANSWER: In many lines, it will just amount
to a transposition, but it does cut out certain black options, notably the ...Nbd7-b6 defence adopted in the game. In view of the potential black
improvement at move 7, White may do better to prefer the immediate 5 Qc2, as
advocated by both Kosten and Nigel Davies (the latter in his excellent book,
'The Dynamic Reti', which overlaps with various lines of the English).} -- (

ANSWER: Yes. He has the pawn centre (d4 and e4 can follow), pressure on the
open queenside files (the c6-pawn is backward, and likely to stay that way
after White's d2-d4 advance), and Black's development is hampered. Marin now

White has a major alternative here, in} 7. a4 a5 {and only now} 8. Na3 {

pawn moves has both good and bad sides. From the positive side, the position
of the black knight on b6 is much less stable, since it is no longer defended
by a pawn on a7. This means that, if the b-file is later opened (e.g. after b3
by White), there may be pressure down the b-file from a white rook on b1. ---
QUESTION: That makes sense. So why not play 7 a4? --- ANSWER: Well, in chess,
as in life, there is no such thing as a free lunch. Including the moves 7 a4
a5 weakens the b4-square, so Black may be able to put a minor piece there and
thus plug the b-file anyway. A high-level example where these moves were

However, there are some move-order issues again. --- QUESTION: I knew it! ---
ANSWER: Nigel Davies has argued that White should think twice about allowing
the kind of Reversed Benoni structures, seen in the next game, if Black has
not committed his king's knight to f6. In support of this view, he cites one
of his own games, C.McNab-N.Davies, Blackpool 2003:} c5 4. e3 Nc6 5. g3 Be7 $1

manoeuvre Nh3-f2 as White is known to be effective in similar Benoni positions,
but can only be achieved against inaccurate black play. Here, Black has been
able to get in ...e5 and reinforce his central pawn chain d4-e5 in ideal
fashion, and is probably already better.}) 3... Nf6 {

White has a couple of options.} 4. -- ({
. The immediate regaining of the pawn by} 4. Qa4+ {is dismissed as toothless
by most authors, on the grounds that Black can reach a comfortable Neo-Catalan
position, by exploiting the white queen's position to play a quick ...a6-b5.
However, I have never been entirely convinced that such positions are as
harmless for Black as popularly believed, as White can hope to exploit the
weakness of the enemy queenside pawns later in the ending. Ulf Andersson fed
his family for years on the proceeds of such positions, and more recently
there was an interesting example from the very highest level:} Nd7 5. Bg2 a6 6.

else White will take on c4, with a small, but comfortable edge:} Bxa3 5. bxa3 {
. --- QUESTION: White is still a pawn down, and has doubled pawns - doesn't
look very impressive! --- ANSWER: Appearances can be deceptive. White has two
bishops, potential control of the dark squares, and the open b-file. If he can
regain the pawn, his central pawn majority will also be a factor. --- QUESTION:
But can't Black defend the pawn with ...b5? --- ANSWER: Yes, but then two
things happen. Firstly, we have the usual Catalan-style pressure down the long
diagonal h1-a8. And secondly, we can play a4, undermining the queenside pawns
- twice! --- QUESTION: Twice? --- ANSWER: Yes, twice! That's where the doubled
a-pawns come in handy. White can advance a4, take on b5, and then potentially
push the second a-pawn to a4 as well, undermining the black queenside completely. Marin gives extensive treatment of this whole variation, which we cannot do
here, for space reasons. But a typical example is something like this:} Nf6 6.

with extremely active pieces, as compensation for the small material deficit.})
) 4. b3 {QUESTION: Ah, so is this your big idea? --- ANSWER: A bit less
sarcasm, if you please, sir! This is the key move of White's intended anti-QGD
plan, yes. He defends the c4-pawn, and plans a slow build-up with a double
fianchetto and short castling. What happens after that will depend on how
Black reacts.} Be7 5. Bg2 O-O 6. O-O c5 7. Bb2 Nc6 8. e3 {This is pretty much
a tabiya for this variation. Black now has to make a major choice, which will

Exchange on c4. -- 3. Maintain the tension, with something like ...b6, ...Bb7,

plan is seen in the present main game. The third plan is examined in the note

the text is natural, isn't it? --- ANSWER: Yes, but there are potentially
problems with the third plan. --- QUESTION: Such as? --- ANSWER: Well, the
main issue is that sooner or later, White is likely to be able to clarify the
central pawn structure favourably, by exchanging on d5. We will see this is
the next note.}) 10. Qe2 ({

a constant threat of dxc5, saddling Black with either an IQP or hanging pawns

in a few moves. But, as we shall see, this does not solve all Black's problems:

Bc5 {Black will liquidate his weakness with ...d4.}) {QUESTION: Surely White
has nothing after 15 exd4, has he? After all, the pawn structure is
symmetrical, with both sides having an IQP. --- ANSWER: Despite this, White is
better placed to take control of the centre here. Botvinnik was a master of
such "mutual IQP" positions, and won a number of highly instructive games in
such structures. For a very good treatment of his prowess, see the Kotov
chapter on fixed pawn centres, in the old classic book 'The Art of the
Middlegame' by Kotov and Keres. In this case, we see White exploiting the

exchange on c4 has clarified the pawn structure. White has a central majority,
and Black a majority on the queenside. --- QUESTION: So is White going to push
d4? --- ANSWER: Well, you might think so, but traditionally, he has tended not
to do that. --- QUESTION: Why? --- ANSWER: Mainly because it was always
thought that the pawn on c4 would be too weak, especially with the white
bishop on g2. For that reason, White has usually tended to play d3, keeping
things solid in the centre, and then advance on the kingside. We see this plan
in the main game. However, having said that, in recent years, White players
have begun to take the d4 plan more seriously, and it is now rather more
common in practice. Marin is one who recommends that approach.} Qc7 {Actually,

largely supplanted the older, slower plan with d3.}))) 12. d3 {QUESTION: So
what is White's idea here? It looks rather a modest way to play. --- ANSWER:
White intends a slower build-up. He stabilizes the centre and will continue by
moving his knight from f3, and pushing f4 and, probably, later g4. Although it
looks slow, practice has shown that this can also be quite dangerous and
requires careful defence from Black.} a6 13. Ne1 Na7 {QUESTION: Black's last

a popular way to preserve independent English contours, rather than

two distinct approaches after the exchange on c4: he can play in restrained
central fashion, with d3 and a kingside advance, or he can use his central
majority in a more ambitious and dynamic way, by pushing d4. Both plans offer
good prospects, although the latter is more popular at the time of writing.}

idea of putting the rook on b5 (see the notes to Black's 12th, below), and

I doubt that Miles was familiar with the Botvinnik predecessor game, because
it was played against a relatively weak opponent in a team event, and did not
appear in Botvinnik's best games collection. I found it a few years ago,
whilst browsing through old Soviet magazines, in the Max Euwe Centrum library

With this advance, he changes the structure fundamentally, producing a kind of
reversed Benoni.} 9. exd4 cxd4 {QUESTION: So how does it compare with a normal
Benoni? --- ANSWER: There are a few differences. On the plus side, White has
an extra tempo, of course, by virtue of being White. In addition, he will gain
another tempo if the black pawn advances to e5, having taken two moves to get
there, instead of one. --- QUESTION: And the minus side? --- ANSWER: White has
already committed his queen's bishop to b2. In the normal Modern Benoni, the
bishop rarely ends up on b7 - more often, it develops to g4, for example. ---
QUESTION: So is b2 a bad square for the bishop? --- ANSWER: It depends. If
Black can achieve ...e5 in favourable circumstances, and solidify his central
pawn chain, then the bishop can find itself biting on granite. On the other
hand, it currently exerts pressure against the d4-pawn, and if White can hold
up Black's ...e5 advance, then the bishop can be a source of worry for Black.}

aim in this line. The knight can then come to c7, possibly on its way to the
square c5, a typical post for a knight in such Modern Benoni structures. ---
White replies with} 11. Ne5 $1 {. Slower plans have also been tried, but this
seems best. Black cannot be prevented from playing ...f6 and ...e5, but White
exchanges a pair of knights, slightly relieving his cramp, and opens the paths

In this position, with the possibility of holding up Black's ...e5 advance,
the idea of attacking d4 with another white minor piece is especially

that 11 a3 is a bad move, merely that 11 d3 is a touch more flexible. It is
really just common sense - it is 100% clear that White will want to play d3 at

cxd4 8. Qxd4 d6 {QUESTION: I have never understood the Hedgehog. Why isn't
Black just cramped and therefore worse? After all, in the Open Sicilian, after
1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 Nxd4, Black almost always plays 4...Nf6,
precisely to stop White establishing this type of Maroczy Bind formation with
pawns on c4 and e4, so why does Black allow it here? --- ANSWER: That is a
good question! It has taken the chess world many years to appreciate the
viability of Black's set-up. In the first place, having less space is not in
itself a bad thing. A position is not cramped just because it has less space -
rather, it is only cramped if it has too little space to accommodate its
pieces comfortably. In the Hedgehog, Black's piece formation fits quite neatly
into the three ranks, and the pieces are not usually tripping over themselves
or getting in each other's way. The big difference with the Open Sicilian you
mentioned is that White's pieces are less aggressively placed here. In
particular, the white bishop on g2 does not bear down on Black's king, in the
way it would if it were on d3. These are the keys to the viability of the
black position.} 9. Bg5 {This is one of White's best approaches. It is less
ambitious than some other set-ups, but White aims just to damp down Black's
dynamic potential and secure a position where he has a small edge in a quiet
manoeuvring battle. Such an approach should suit the English player.} a6 10.
Bxf6 {QUESTION: Eh? This looks really odd. I thought that, when one had more
space, one should avoid exchanges, which help ease the defender's cramp? Here,
White not only exchanges bishop for knight, he even does so without waiting
for the bishop to be prodded with ...h6! --- ANSWER: Well, as I said in the
previous note, Black's position in the Hedgehog is not really "cramped" in the
general sense of the term. He already has enough space to manoeuvre his pieces,
so this exchange makes relatively little difference in that sense. The really
unusual thing about the Hedgehog is that the exchange of a minor piece or two
frequently has the effect of reducing the dynamic potential of Black's
position. All those brilliancies one sees, where Black smashes his way out
with breaks such as ...b5 and ...d5, almost always occur on a board full of
pieces - an exchange or two draws much of that dynamic potential and creates a
quieter position.} Bxf6 11. Qf4 O-O ({
QUESTION: Can't Black take on c3 here? The white pawns look very weak after} 
11... Bxc3 12. bxc3 {. --- ANSWER: Maybe, but so too is the black pawn on d6,
which will be extremely hard to defend after a white rook comes to the d-file.}
) 12. Rfd1 ({One example of the Anderson plan (see the notes to White's 19th,
below) is a recent one, and sees the basic Andersson plan implemented, but in

Black's position.} Bxe4 14. Qxe4 Ra7 {QUESTION: So, what is the result of the
opening? --- ANSWER: White has a small edge. The exchanges have produced a
fairly quiet position, where manoeuvring is the order of the day. We will not
see White trying to storm the black position with pawn advances such as f4 and
g4, such as occur in some Hedgehog lines. Here, White has a specific long-term
idea in mind. He intends the dreaded "Andersson plan"! --- QUESTION: And what
is that when it's at home? --- ANSWER: Basically, it is all about the square

ANSWER: Okay, now is the time to reveal White's idea. He intends to get his
knight to c6, as we have said. To do that, he needs to get his pawn to b5, to
cover the c6-square; then, after a later exchange on c6, White will have a
monster passed pawn when he recaptures b5xc6. --- QUESTION: Yes, but how is
White going to get his pawn to b5, without losing his c4-pawn? --- ANSWER:
Well, here is the idea: White intends a4, followed by putting his queen on a2!
--- QUESTION: You are kidding me? --- ANSWER: Not at all! From a2, the queen
defends c4. He will then defend the pawn again, maybe with a rook, or by e3
and Bf1, and eventually, when c4 is secured, he will play b4, then b5, and
finally Nc6. --- QUESTION: That is what I call a long-term plan! --- ANSWER:

In this case, Gashimov has broken his bonds and simplified the position, but
he has not completely escaped his troubles. White has an outside passed pawn

obtain a relatively quiet position, in which he can play for a small edge. The
celebrated "Andersson plan" is one method, whilst the system with e3 and a
subsequent Nxd4 dovetails quite nicely with the anti-QGD approach recommended
in this chapter. Either method should suit the English Opening player.} 1-0

1. c4 {. This chapter deals with three of Black's most popular mainline 1 d4
defences, which he can attempt to apply against the English. The Grnfeld
Defence is one of the most frequently seen defences at the top level, and is
thus correspondingly popular at lower levels too, but it does not work
especially well against the English. This is because, like many hypermodern
defences, the Grnfeld is essentially a counterattacking system, which allows
White to set up a big pawn centre, so that it can be attacked from the flanks.
In the English, however, White can hold back his centre pawns, which has the
effect of denying Black the obvious target that he has in the main lines, and
this tends to prove quite effective in practice. Marin-Ris presents the white
set-up I recommend. I think it is quite significant that two of the greatest
Grnfeld practitioners of all time, Fischer and Kasparov, both preferred to
avoid the Grnfeld response 1...Nf6 and 2...d5 against the English. ---
Kosten-Bujisho then deals with the King's Indian set-up by Black. This is
another hugely popular opening at almost all levels, and one of the reasons
for its popularity is that Black can develop along King's Indian lines,
largely within his own ranks, and thus can adopt the KID set-up against almost
any White opening. This universality makes it a very useful practical weapon.
If White prefers not to transpose into a King's Indian proper, then he has two
main English-style approaches. One is a Nf3, g3 and d3 set-up, similar to
White's play in Seirawan-Narciso Dublan. However, this is relatively toothless
against the King's Indian, and does not promise White any hope of a
theoretical advantage. The other system, which I concentrate on as the main
line, is the Botvinnik System, but, for the reasons explained in the notes, I
do not think this objectively promises White any advantage either. However,
the Botvinnik is an excellent practical weapon, since White is able to force
his own, familiar type of middlegame, and it scores very well for White at
anything below top GM level, so I think it is definitely the best choice,
unless White is prepared to enter a mainline King's Indian. --- Finally,
Kasparov-Short looks at English set-ups against the Dutch. Here too, I suggest
a Botvinnik formation against the Dutch Leningrad, whilst the traditional
Nf3-g3-d3 set-up works well against ...e6 Dutch lines. The Stonewall, in
particular, strikes me as rather pleasant to play against as White, if one is
not committed to putting one's d-pawn on d4.} *

assume you are not actually going to allow a transposition into any kind of
normal Grnfeld? --- ANSWER: Exactly right. White plans to hold back his
d-pawn, which will generally go to d3. This will rule out the standard black
Grnfeld counterplay against the white centre (in particular, against the pawn
on d4). --- QUESTION: That is all very well, but is it entirely logical? After
all, White still has the central pawn majority characteristic of the Grnfeld.
If he does not use it, isn't he just throwing away his main strategic asset,
just in order to get Black out of his favourite lines? --- ANSWER: Not really.
White is not renouncing the advance of his central pawns forever. Rather, in
typical hypermodern style, he is declining to set up his pawns in the centre
early on, where they can become a target. He will bide his time and only come
into the centre later, after he has taken steps to prevent the black
counterplay developing in the usual way.} g6 5. Bg2 Nb6 (5... Nxc3 {is the alternative, and probably the most natural reaction for a Grnfeld player:} 6. bxc3

unpleasant for Black to meet in these positions. White settles for a different
type of position from the usual Grnfeld, one where Black perhaps finds it
less easy to get his bearings. --- QUESTION: So what is White's idea? ---

He places his pawns on c4 and d3, he has the b-file, and he has ideas of
bringing his knight to e4 (via d2 or g5), and eventually, possibly, d5. If
Black plays ...b6, then the plan a4-a5 may be a factor. --- Play continues} Qc7

QUESTION: What is the exclamation mark for? Just pleased with yourself for the
plan of d3, rather than d4? --- ANSWER: I am not that egotistical! No, 6 d3 is
the most precise execution of White's plan. He intends a rapid Be3-Qd2,
threatening to exchange off the Grnfeld bishop by Bh6. Once that bishop has
gone, Black will find it much more difficult to create his usual counterplay

We are generally used to seeing the central pawns moved early on, and the king

noted in the comments to that game, the Botvinnik System is less effective
against this formation than against the ...e5 set-up. This is because here,
Black keeps open the long diagonal of his bishop at g7. In addition, the
advance f4 by White is generally less dangerous without a black pawn on e5 -
White is not threatening to open the f-file, for example. --- QUESTION: So,
are you saying you do not recommend the Botvinnik System here? --- ANSWER: I
would not go that far, but, as noted in the chapter introduction, I do think
that objectively, White cannot really count on any advantage in this line.
Even so, from a practical viewpoint, it has some benefits. White forces "his"
position, and from the club player's perspective, the Botvinnik has quite a
strong appeal, because of its "shut your eyes" qualities - White can play many
of the same moves almost independently of what his opponent is up to, which is
something many average players like.} (6... e5 $6 {is not to be recommended.

1. c4 f5 {With this move, Black announces that he intends to force a
transposition into some kind of Dutch Defence. --- QUESTION: So do we have to
acquiesce? --- ANSWER: The late and great Tigran Petrosian once said that "if
your opponent wants to play the Dutch, do not, whatever you do, try to stop
him!" On that basis, perhaps White should transpose, but most of us do not
play the White side of the Dutch quite as well as Tigran Vartanovich, and,
besides, there are both subjective and objective reasons for not transposing.
--- QUESTION: Such as? --- ANSWER: Subjectively, it is obviously nice to avoid
the opponent's pet line. Objectively, one of the main strategic ideas of the
Dutch is to fight for the square e4. With White's pawn already committed to d4,
that idea makes some sense, but if White can still put his pawn on d3, playing
...f5 is arguably rather riskier. So, in this book, we will look at ways White
can try to preserve a more "English" structure.} 2. Nf3 {As we will see, this
move-order is not the best for the approach recommended here, since White
gives up the option of a Botvinnik System, with the knight going to e2.} ({
I therefore recommend the move-order} 2. g3 {. --- QUESTION: Why does this
matter? --- ANSWER: The point is that Black has three main set-ups in the
Dutch: The Ilyin-Zhenevsky, or Classical Dutch, with ...e6 and ...d6; the
Stonewall with ...e6 and ...d5; and the Leningrad with ...d6 and ...g6. My
recommended set-up here is that White fianchetto his king's bishop in all
three cases, and that he play Nf3 against the first two lines, and a Botvinnik
System against the Leningrad. In order to preserve his options, therefore,
White must first develop his king's bishop, and wait until Black shows his
hand. --- QUESTION: You really are a devious character! --- ANSWER: I will
take that as a compliment! --- After} Nf6 3. Bg2 {
Black must reveal his cards. Will he play ...e6 or ...g6?} -- (3... e6 4. Nf3 {
transposes back to the main game.}) ({
. If Black wants to play a Leningrad, he will usually play} 3... g6 {
here. Now we switch to a Botvinnik Formation, with} 4. Nc3 Bg7 5. d3 O-O 6. e4
d6 7. Nge2 {. --- QUESTION: How is this different from other Botvinnik lines
we have looked at? --- ANSWER: Assuming Black plays ...e5, it is different
only in that he has not yet committed his queen's knight to c6. If he does so
here, we reach lines examined in Moskalenko-Mestre Bellido. --- The
alternative is to play ...c6. For example:} c6 8. O-O e5 {. --- QUESTION: We
have seen something like this in the notes to the previous game, haven't we?
--- ANSWER: Not quite. There, we looked at lines where Black plays ...c6, but
with his knight blocking his f-pawn. Here, he has played ...f5 as well. ---
QUESTION: What difference does that make? --- ANSWER: I would say that this is
a slightly better formation, since, as we have emphasized throughout this book,
Black does not usually want to block his f-pawn in these Botvinnik structures.
Even so, I think White has an edge here:} 9. exf5 $1 ({
this exchange is important, as Black was threatening} 9. -- f4 $1 {
, with the idea} 10. gxf4 Nh5 $1 {, a thematic and dangerous pawn sacrifice,
which would give him excellent kingside chances}) 9... gxf5 {
. --- QUESTION: Can't Black take with the bishop?} ({
ANSWER: Yes, but then he loses control of e4. After} 9... Bxf5 {
, White continues} 10. h3 $1 {
and then d4, with g4 and Ng3 in mind at a later stage as well.}) 10. d4 {
. Once again, White has a small, but pleasant edge. Kosten quotes one of his
own games, which was typical:} Na6 11. b3 Nc7 12. Ba3 e4 13. Nf4 Re8 14. d5 c5
15. Bb2 Bd7 16. a4 {with a clear positional advantage (f3 is coming, breaking
up Black's structure), A.Kosten-Marcellin, Cannes 1998.}) (3... d6 {is Black's
only attempt to preserve options - the Stonewall is now ruled out, but he can
still play the Classical or the Leningrad. White should therefore delay the
development of his king's knight for one more move with} 4. Nc3 {
after which Black struggles to avoid revealing his hand..})) 2... Nf6 3. g3 e6
4. Bg2 Be7 {
As we will see, Black still intends a Stonewall, but with his bishop on e7.} ({
The more modern Stonewall treatment usually involves putting the bishop on d6,
in which case Black is likely to prefer} 4... d5 {here, and then} 5. O-O c6 6.
Nc3 Bd6 {. Here White could play  la Kasparov, with the exchange on d5,
followed by e3, etc. However, with the black bishop on d6, he also has another,
even more effective plan, viz.} 7. d3 O-O 8. e4 $1 {. This immediately cracks
Black's wall, and practice suggests his position is rather difficult here, e.g.

and White will regain the pawn with an obvious advantage.}) 5. O-O O-O 6. Nc3
d5 {The text finally shows Black's hand - it is to be a Stonewall.} ({
QUESTION: So what about} 6... d6 {, with a Classical Dutch? --- ANSWER: Well,
of course, White again has the option of transposing by} 7. d4 {, but I see no
need for that. --- QUESTION: But if we don't play d4, isn't Black going to get
in ...e5 himself, a move he always aims for in the Dutch?} ({ANSWER: Yes, but
in the English, he can play that at move one! Here, he has taken two moves to
achieve it, whilst we just get on with our standard English queenside play:} 7.
b4 e5 8. d3 c6 9. Bb2 Qe8 10. e3 Na6 {was the game M.Illescas Cordoba-J.Pomes

with a nice Dutch for White, who has made extensive progress on the queenside.}
)) 7. cxd5 ({QUESTION: What is wrong with the plan of} 7. d3 c6 8. e4 {
here, as we saw in a previous note? --- ANSWER: Nothing really, although it is
slightly less effective with Black's bishop on e7, as White is not threatening
to win a piece with the fork e5. Even so, after} d4 9. Ne2 fxe4 ({or} 9... c5
10. exf5 exf5 11. b4 $1) 10. dxe4 Nxe4 11. Nexd4 {
White has some advantage, as given by Marin.}) 7... exd5 8. e3 {QUESTION: What
is White doing here? --- ANSWER: Basically, he intends to retain his d-pawn on
d2/d3 for the long term. This will deprive Black of the use of the square e4.
White will bring his knight to d4, fianchetto the queen's bishop and
eventually prepare a queenside minority attack. --- QUESTION: Are you saying
White is better? --- ANSWER: I would claim he is somewhat better, yes. It is
not a hugely ambitious approach, but it produces a quiet, manoeuvring game,
where White has a safe edge. It is a particularly effective approach for a
rapid game, which this game was - at such time-limits, a simple, clear plan is
worth its weight in gold.} Kh8 9. b3 Nc6 10. Bb2 Be6 11. Ne2 Bg8 12. d3 {
Here, we see the key points of White's set-up. Without access to the e4-square,
it is hard for Black to create any serious kingside counterplay, and he would
much prefer to be able to play the move ...f5-f7 (admittedly, not with his
bishop on g8, but you know what I mean!).} Qd7 13. a3 Bd6 14. Qc2 Rae8 15. b4 {
White starts his minority attack.} Ng4 16. Ned4 Nce5 17. Rac1 c6 18. Bc3 {
QUESTION: What is this move for? --- ANSWER: White has ideas of Qb2, strengthening the pressure along the a1-h8 diagonal, as well as putting some beef behind
the b-pawn.} Nxf3+ 19. Nxf3 Re7 20. Qb2 Qe8 21. Bd4 $1 {A nice, instructive
move. --- QUESTION: Why? What is the point? --- ANSWER: White intends Bc5,
exchanging dark-squared bishops. This is almost always a favourable exchange
for White in Stonewall positions, because Black's dark squares are weakened by
the d5-f5 pawn structure, and the dark-squared bishop is a key defender of
them.} a6 22. Bc5 Rf6 23. Bxd6 Rxd6 24. Qd4 Bf7 25. a4 Bh5 26. Rb1 Nh6 27. b5 {
The classic minority attack break.} axb5 28. axb5 Bxf3 29. Bxf3 Nf7 30. Bh5 $1
{Another excellent exchanging operation. Black would be happy to keep his
knight, which defends his dark squares, whilst White's light-squared bishop
cannot attack them. Kasparov instead forces the exchange of the minor pieces,
knowing that the heavy piece ending will leave him with the better chances.
Black will have a weakness on c6 and a weakened king position.} Rh6 31. Bxf7
Rxf7 32. bxc6 bxc6 33. Rb6 Rf8 34. Qc5 {This kind of heavy piece ending is a
typical outcome of the minority attack. With only the c6-weakness, Black would
have good chances to hold, but here, his problems are exacerbated by the fact
that his kingside has been seriously weakened by the move ...f5. I recall
Grandmaster Murray Chandler once telling me,  propos the Stonewall, that "It
is all very well, but when you play it against the likes of Salov, or some
other world-class GM, then somewhere around move 35, you find yourself really
wishing you could put that wretched pawn back on f7!"} g5 {QUESTION: This
weakens his kingside even more, doesn't it? --- ANSWER: Yes, but it is a
typical "Prisoner's Dilemma" in such positions: if he plays passively, White
can strengthen his position at his leisure, whilst if he seeks active
counterplay, he creates even more weaknesses. Creating counterplay is usually
the better practical option. Short starts to make a very good fist of fighting
back from here onwards.} 35. Rc1 f4 (35... Rff6 {
defends the pawn for the time being, but a line such as} 36. Qb4 Kg7 37. Qb2 {

arising.}) 40... fxg3 41. hxg3 Ra3 42. Rf3 Kg7 43. Kg2 d4 44. Kh3 h5 45. Kh4

59. Rc2 {. --- Whilst there may be no objective reason to avoid a
transposition into standard Dutch lines, the English offers some attractive
independent set-ups against Black's various Dutch formations. The Stonewall,
in particular, strikes me as rather dubious, if White has not committed his

1. c4 {. In the first instance, the English can be used not as an independent
opening system in its own right, but merely as a transpositional device. A
player whose basic repertoire starts with 1 d4 can utilize the English as a
way of avoiding certain black defences, whilst retaining the option of
transposing back into regular 1 d4 territory against other defences.} -- ({
One simple example is when playing an opponent who relies on the Queen's
Gambit Accepted (QGA) as Black: 1 d4 d5 2 c4 dxc4. If one is keen to avoid
this, perhaps because one's opponent is a particular expert, or because one's
favoured line against it has recently sustained a theoretical "hit" and is
temporarily in need of repair, one can open 1 c4. This precludes the QGA
altogether, and poses the opponent a slight problem. He has to be careful not
to be "move-ordered". For example, if he answers} 1... Nf6 {, then after} 2. d4
{(!), we have dodged his QGA and forced him into a position usually reached
via 1 d4 Nf6 2 c4, which is our normal repertoire, but not his.}) ({Likewise,} 
1... e6 2. d4 {also reaches a position that is probably not part of his
regular repertoire. Many QGA experts answer the English with 1...e5, precisely
because it is one reply that avoids any risk of being move-ordered into a 1 d4
system that is not part of their usual repertoire.}) ({Another group of
players, against whom the English can be used as a transpositional tool, are
Grnfeld players. The Grnfeld Defence, 1 d4 Nf6 2 c4 g6 3 Nc3 d5, is one of
the most theoretically developed of all 1 d4 openings, having been very
popular at top GM level in recent years, in the hands of such players as
Kasparov, Anand, Svidler and others. However, by choosing 1 c4, one can avoid
the Grnfeld altogether. As we saw in Marin-Ris, if Black insists on trying to
reach the Grnfeld, by} 1... Nf6 2. Nc3 d5 {, then the lines after} 3. cxd5
Nxd5 4. g3 {are quite pleasant for White, as Black does not have the usual
white pawn centre as a ready target.}) ({
Likewise, if Black is careless enough to answer 1 c4 with} 1... Nf6 2. Nc3 g6 {
, naively hoping for 3 d4 d5, reaching his beloved Grnfeld, then of course,
we can cross him up with} 3. e4 $1 {, after which Black finds himself forced
into a King's Indian instead. --- Naturally, there is nothing objectively
wrong with the King's Indian per se, but it leads to very different structures
from the Grnfeld. The latter usually gives rise to open positions, where
Black has long-range pieces attacking the white centre (e.g. the g7-bishop, a
rook on d8, etc) along the diagonals and central files. The King's Indian, by
contrast, much more often results in a blocked centre, and many Grnfeld
players do not feel comfortable in such structures (the English IM, David
Goodman, once told me that "Grnfeld players are obsessed - they have to open
the position, even when it's obviously not good!"). --- This idea of using the
English to avoid the Grnfeld, whilst allowing the King's Indian, can also be
incorporated into a more general English repertoire. As the reader will have
seen from my comments in the Chapter 5 introduction, I am not all that
convinced that pure English set-ups objectively offer much against the King's
Indian. The Botvinnik System, explored in Kosten-Bujisho, is less effective
against ...c5 than ...e5, whilst the Nf3/d3 lines are also fairly toothless
against a King's Indian set-up. Consequently, even if the white player is
using 1 c4 as his main weapon, rather than merely as an occasional
transpositional tool, there is some sense in answering 1 c4 Nf6 2 Nc3 g6 with
3 e4, forsaking independent English paths and heading back into the King's
Indian proper.}) ({Going back to the idea of using 1 c4 merely as a way of
avoiding certain 1 d4 main lines, it should be noted that the Benoni (1 d4 Nf6
2 c4 c5), including the Benko Gambit (1 d4 Nf6 2 c4 c5 3 d5 b5), can be dodged
by playing 1 c4, e.g.} 1... Nf6 2. Nc3 {, and now:} -- (2... c5 {can be met by}
3. g3 ({or} 3. Nf3 {first, forcing an English line, as seen in Chapter 2.})) ({
. Similarly, the Nimzo-Indian (1 d4 Nf6 2 c4 e6 3 Nc3 Bb4) can be avoided by} 
2... e6 3. e4 {, the Mikenas Attack, as covered in Chapter 3.})) (1... -- {
In summary, the 1 d4 player can use the English as a transpositional tool, to
avoid a number of the main defences to 1 c4. This can be a useful way of
dodging a particular opponent's favourite defence, in a one-off game, and can
also be used as a more permanent opening repertoire trick, for example, by
always opening 1 c4, but then being prepared to transpose back into various 1
d4 main lines, whilst avoiding certain others.}) *

{The second move dilemma: -- Assuming that White intends to use} 1. c4 {
as a permanent repertoire choice, his biggest decision comes as early as move
2. Basically, the question is whether he should answer 1...e5/1...Nf6 with 2
Nc3 or 2 g3.} -- {"Ich bin ein Kostenite" -- Ever since the publication of
Tony Kosten's groundbreaking repertoire book The Dynamic English, in 1999, the
dominant move-order amongst English Opening practitioners has been 1 c4,
followed by} 2. g3 {. Kosten's book, although containing fewer than 150 pages,
provided White players with a complete repertoire, based on these first two
moves, and proved immensely influential. This same initial move-order has been
recommended by Mihail Marin, in his more recent and much more detailed series
of repertoire books for the white player. --- The advantage of the 2 g3
move-order, as explained by Kosten himself, is to avoid certain of the most
theoretical English lines. In particular, the Four Knights English lines,
beginning 1 c4 e5 2 Nc3 Nf6 3 Nf3 Nc6 4 g3, and now both 4...Bb4 and 4...d5
have a large body of theory behind them, as we have seen in Chapter 1. In
addition, Black has various sidelines, such as 2...Bb4, which Kosten's
move-order avoids. The main point of the Kosten move-order can be summed up as
follows: if White is going to play g3 at some point anyway, then he may as
well play it on move 2. By doing so, he avoids certain heavily theoretical
lines, as well as a few less significant sidelines. --- However, one rarely
gets anything for nothing in this life, and the chessboard is no exception.
The Kosten move-order also has several drawbacks, and now is the time to
consider these.} *

back into the main lines, considered in Brunello-Brunner. Objectively, this is
probably the strongest move and is the course recommended by Marin. As
demonstrated in Brunello-Brunner, White can probably hope for a small
advantage in such positions, although with this variation, White is dealing
with a large body of theory.}) ({. Instead of this, Kosten suggests taking
advantage of the delayed development of White's queen's knight, to adopt a
slightly different set-up:} 7. d3 Be7 8. Nbd2 {. White will continue with a3
and - assuming Black responds ...a5, preventing the queenside expansion - b3
and Bb2. This produces a slightly different position from the main line. White
has immediate pressure against the black e5-pawn, and will virtually force the
move ...f6, thus preventing more aggressive black formations involving ...f5.
White will also be able to play e3 and d4, recapturing with a piece on d4,
something which would not be available with his knight on c3. Kosten claims a
slight advantage for White in these lines. --- This is certainly an
interesting set-up for White, which avoids some of the more heavily analysed
lines after 7 Nc3, and which poses Black slightly different problems. However,
since Kosten's book came out, quite a lot of games have been played in this
line, and it seems clear that Black has no real problems. One example,
featuring one of the world's greatest experts on both sides of this line, was
the game J.Van Mechelen-M.Gurevich, Belgian Championship 2001, which continued}

1. c4 {. In the light of the considerations discussed in the previous section,
let us now turn our attention to move-orders in which White does not commit
himself to a very early g3. After 1 c4 e5/Nf6, the classical response has
always been 2 Nc3.} -- ({Of course, with this move White does not pass up the
opportunity to play a subsequent g3; rather, he keeps his options open. Thus,
against} 1... e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 ({on} 2... Nc6 3. g3 {, he can still revert to the
lines considered in the first five games of Chapter 1 with}) {
, he has additional options. In particular, he can play} 3. Nf3 Nc6 {
, and now one of the fourth move alternatives to 4 g3,} 4. -- ({, such as} 4.
e3 {(Ivanchuk-Karjakin)}) ({, and} 4. e4 {(Grachev-Lalic).}) ({
. There are several reasons why he may wish to do this. Firstly, the} 4. g3 {
lines are extremely heavily analysed, both after} Bb4 ({and} 4... d5 {
, and so White may prefer to head for less explored territory. Secondly, the
Reversed Dragon lines with 4...d5 are an especially tough nut to crack, and it
makes sense for White to cultivate other pastures, in the search for an
opening advantage. As explained in the notes to Grachev-Lalic, the old
Nimzowitsch System with 4 e4 seems to offer more chances for an edge than has
hitherto been generally thought, whilst 4 e3 is another rich system, which
offers much relatively unmapped territory.}))) ({A second reason for
preferring the move-order 2 Nc3 is that it allows White some more "muscular"
variations, where he can pose Black immediate problems, rather than just
developing slowly, within his own half of the board. Thus, for example, the
move-order} 1... Nf6 2. Nc3 e6 {can be met with the aggressive Mikenas Attack,}
3. e4 {. As the reader will have seen from Chapter 3, I think the Mikenas is
quite an attractive system for White, especially at anything below top GM
level, because White's early central occupation makes immediate demands of
Black. If he does not respond quite accurately, he can easily be blown out of
the centre, as several of the variations quoted in Chapter 3 demonstrate.}) ({
As we have already discussed several times, the 2 Nc3 move-order also allows
White to play a more aggressive, mainline set-up against the King's Indian,
with an early e4, whilst also avoiding the Grnfeld. In addition, he can
revert to a QGD against} 1... e6 2. Nc3 d5 {, again a more aggressive approach
than the slow, double fianchetto/neo-Catalan systems covered in
McDonald-Nicholson and Miles-Geller, although of course, the QGD main lines
are much better analysed and black opponents can be expected to know what they
are doing in such variations.}) *

1. c4 {. So, what are the drawbacks of 2 Nc3? To my mind, there are not a huge
number, if White is willing to play the Four Knights against 1...e5. The only
real issue is that Black has one or two tricky sidelines, most notably} e5 2.
Nc3 Bb4 {. --- With this move-order, Black hopes to be able to capture on c3
without committing either of his knights;} 3. -- ({e.g. after} 3. g3 Bxc3 {
. Now, whichever way White recaptures, Black can follow up with ...d6, ...f5
and ...Nf6, reaching a much more aggressive structure than in the Four Knights
lines with 4 g3 Bb4. In fact, Black is playing a reversed version of the Grand
Prix Attack or Vinken line against the Sicilian: 1 e4 c5 2 f4 Nc6 3 Nf3 g6 4
Bb5, etc. Such lines are known to be effective for White, and have proved so
as Black also, despite the minus tempo. I still recall being harshly treated
as White in the English line by a very youthful Matthew Sadler, an experience
which put me off the white position forever. Admittedly, cynics might point,
truthfully, if a tad unkindly, to the talent gap between myself and Sadler,
and suggest that the white game might not have looked so bad had the colours
been reversed, but notwithstanding such considerations, I do not recommend 3
g3 for White in this line.}) ({So what should White do after 1 c4 e5 2 Nc3
Bb4? If he is prepared to play the 4 e3 line of the Four Knights, then} 3. Qc2
{looks a decent reply, which may even transpose into that very line. Indeed, a
few months after my drubbing at Sadler's hands, I got a measure of vicarious
revenge, when I watched him lose to GM Suba, who played 3 Qc2. However, this
is not such a suitable line if White intends to adopt a g3-style development,
because Qc2 is likely to prove a waste of time in such lines.}) ({
In that case, White should probably prefer} 3. Nd5 {, when he should be able
to secure a small edge against any of the black bishop retreats.}) *

{One grandmaster, specializing in the English, whose name has cropped up a
number of times in this book, is the Latvian, Normunds Miezis. It is
interesting to study his repertoire in a little more detail, as he uses
several rather unusual systems. --- The first thing to note is that he uses
the 2 Nc3 move-order, including the Mikenas System. However, against most
other lines, he still plays 3 g3, frequently resorting to the Botvinnik System.
This includes the latter against the King's Indian, despite the fact that
Black can play ...c5, rather than ...e5. As I have noted several times already,
I do not think White objectively has any advantage in these lines, but the
generic Botvinnik structure is one in which many players specialize, and can
obtain good practical results, whatever the objective merits of the position.
Miezis is a good example of this, scoring very well as White in such positions.
--- The two most interesting aspects of Miezis' repertoire are as follows. ---
After} 1. c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 {, Miezis plays the move} 3. g3 {.} ({This is a sort
of halfway house between the Kosten 2 g3 and the Four Knights line} 3. Nf3 Nc6
4. g3 {.}) {There are a couple of points which give 3 g3 independence. The
first comes after} 3... Bb4 4. Bg2 O-O {.} 5. -- ({
Now, trying to transpose back into Four Knights lines with} 5. Nf3 {would not be so good, because Black has not committed his queen's knight to c6, and can
employ a set-up without that move. A recent high-level example was H.Nakamura-V.Ivanchuk, Reggio Emilia 2012, which continued} Bxc3 6. bxc3 d6 7.
O-O Re8 8. Ne1 $6 c6 9. d3 h6 10. Rb1 d5 11. Qb3 b6 12. cxd5 cxd5 13. Nc2 Nc6 {
, with an excellent game for Black. In general, I do not recommend this for
White; there seems little point in giving Black the extra option of dispensing
with ...Nc6.}) ({Instead, Miezis' solution is the move} 5. e4 {. With this,
White clamps down on the d5-square, and prepares to prevent the doubling of
his c-pawns by Nge2. Black usually takes the chance to double the pawns, by}
Bxc3 6. dxc3 {and now} d6 {. --- This is a position in which Miezis has
enormous experience; in fact, Megabase 2012 has 49 of his games which reached
this position. His overall score is a healthy 60% as White, but despite this,
I am not entirely convinced White has any advantage. His plan is to put the
queen on e2 and try to bring the knight ultimately to e3. This can be achieved
via f3-d2-f1, or, Miezis' more recent plan, playing the pawn to f3, followed
by Nh3-f2 and eventually via d1-e3. However, both of these plans are rather
slow, and practice suggests that Black is doing well with a rapid ...a6 and ...b5, seeking to open the f1-a6 diagonal, and embarrass the white queen. The
recent game N.Miezis-M.Adams, European Team Championship 2011, continued} 7.
Qe2 Nbd7 8. Nh3 a6 9. f3 b5 10. Be3 bxc4 11. Qxc4 a5 12. Qd3 Ba6 13. Qc2 Qb8 {
, with a good position for Black, who eventually won a long game. Looking more
closely at Miezis' statistics in this line, it is striking that he has scored
extremely well against lower-rated players, but has lost almost every time he
has faced an opponent rated higher than himself. This suggests it is a line
where the better player will win - that may make it attractive or otherwise,
to potential white players, depending on their opposition.}) *

{Another Miezis' speciality is his way of meeting} 1. c4 e6 {. Rather than
transposing into a QGD, or adopting a system based on g3, he plays the line} 2.
e4 d5 3. exd5 exd5 4. d4 {. This in fact transposes into a position which
could arise from the Exchange Variation of the French Defence, after 1 e4 e6 2
d4 d5 3 exd5 exd5 4 c4. This in itself should be enough to confirm that White
has no objective grounds for hoping for an advantage, but once again, Miezis
is relying less on objective factors, and more on his own greater experience
with the position. After the almost inevitable exchange on c4, we will reach
an IQP structure, but one where Black has a pawn on the c-file, rather than
the e-file. This changes the position somewhat. In particular, the square f7
can be more vulnerable than usual, with a white bishop on c4 and a knight
potentially coming to e5 (Qb3 is another way of strengthening the pressure
against f7). Similar structures can also arise from the QGA variation 1 d4 d5
2 c4 dxc4 3 e3 e5 4 Bxc4 exd4 5 exd4, where practice shows that Black is
objectively okay with accurate play, but needs to be careful. --- Once again,
Miezis has played this line numerous times - no fewer than 174 games on
Megabase 2012, and with a highly impressive score of 69% as White. Once again,
though, he has usually come unstuck against top-class opposition, which again
suggests this is a line which works effectively again weaker opponents, but
less so when the white player is outclassed by his opponent. Here is a nice
example of how effective it can be, even against GM-strength opposition (see
Miezis-Akesson).} *

1. c4 {. Objectively, there is not really anything much to choose between the
Kosten move-order with 2 g3, and the classical 2 Nc3, and the decision is
largely a matter of taste. Despite the title of Kosten's book, I actually
think the 2 Nc3 move-order is rather more dynamic than 2 g3, chiefly because
of the availability of more aggressive options, with an early e4, and (often)
dispensing with the fianchetto of the light-squared bishop. I personally also
find the option of transposing into some main line 1 d4 openings, such as the
King's Indian, quite an attractive feature of this line, whilst the option of
non-g3 lines in the 1...e5 Four Knights position is an added incentive to
prefer 2 Nc3. --- On the other hand, the Kosten 2 g3 move-order provides a
more self-contained repertoire, with fewer options for Black to disrupt
White's standard English development. Structures such as the Botvinnik System,
whatever their objective merits, can be highly effective in practice, in the
hands of an experienced English player, who is familiar with the ins and outs
of such heavyweight positions. --- At the end of the day, you pays your money
and you takes your choice. As I hope I have demonstrated in this book, the
English Opening is an extremely flexible weapon, which suits many different
players and styles, and I hope that I have helped you improve your
understanding of it. I wish you every success with the English Opening, in
your chess career.} *
