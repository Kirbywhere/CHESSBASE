1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 {. This new series provides an ideal platform
to study chess openings. By continually challenging the reader to answer
probing questions throughout the book, the Move by Move format greatly
encourages the learning and practising of vital skills just as much as the
traditional assimilation of opening knowledge. Carefully selected questions
and answers are designed to keep you actively involved and allow you to
monitor your progress as you learn. This is an excellent way to study any
chess opening and at the same time improve your general chess skills and
knowledge. --- The Four Knights is an opening with a long and distinguished
history. Despite its deceptively quiet appearance, it can lead to extremely
sharp play - for example in the Belgrade Gambit - as well as more strategic
battles in the main lines. In this book, Cyrus Lakdawala invites you to join
him in examining the many different variations of the Four Knights. He shares
his experience and knowledge, studies the typical plans and tactics for both
sides, offers repertoire options and provides answers to all the key questions.

{'Move by Move' is a series of opening books which uses a question-and-answer
format. One of our main aims of the series is to replicate - as much as
possible - lessons between chess teachers and students. --- All the way
through, readers will be challenged to answer searching questions and to
complete exercises, to test their skills in chess openings and indeed in other
key aspects of the game. It's our firm belief that practising your skills like
this is an excellent way to study chess openings, and to study chess in
general.} 1. -- {Many thanks go to all those who have been kind enough to
offer inspiration, advice and assistance in the creation of 'Move by Move'.

{Why Play the Four Knights? -- The question arises: Why play the Four Knights
when we have access to pedigreed openings like the Ruy Lopez and the Scotch?
Why build a product when no need of it exists? Some say playing the Four
Knights is the same as the mercenary who deserts from a winning army. For me,
the appeal of the Four Knights is primarily that we remove the super-booked
Schliemann Lopez specialist or Scotch guy out of his main prep and re-route
him directly into our world. --- The Four Knights is not so much an
independent opening as it is a confusing (for Black, hopefully!) facsimile of
other lines. For instance, the Four Knights Spanish is a Ruy Lopez-like line;
the Four Knights Scotch is, well, Scotch-like; the Belgrade Gambit is
Max-Lange-like and the Glek is King's Indian-like. Now the "like" part is
rather important. It throws most of your opponents off their normal
theoretical strides. For instance, in Chapter 2, the Rubinstein Gambit is
similar to but actually quite different from the Lopez Marshall Gambit. I
guarantee that you will be the more booked-up player 95% of the time. An
example: I played in the 2011 American Open G/30, facing a master in one of
the key later rounds. We entered the Rubinstein Gambit and reached the
following critical position after six moves:} 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4.
Bb5 Nd4 5. Ba4 c6 6. Nxe5 {. This is a sharp theoretical pawn sac from Black
(see Chapter 2). In this case, my opponent's desire to challenge White with a
theoretically sharp line exceeded reality; he lacked a grip on the theory. It
is a dangerous game to cross an opponent with knowledge of sharp theory unless
you carry compensating knowledge. My opponent sat frozen for several minutes
and ate up about 15% of his time right there! He knew the theory up to move
six but now was at a loss on how to proceed. He couldn't remember his
theoretical prep. Needless to say, he misplayed it and compounded his trouble
by his unfamiliarity with the line. Do you think this would have happened if I
had opened with a Lopez? He would undoubtedly have known (and more importantly
understood) his theory to move 19 or so. This is why I play the Four Knights.
Players just don't face the Four Knights very often, so when you hit them with
it, it has been ages since they last looked at it. Also, we, not your
opponents, get to pick the "like" in the position, be it the Lopez, Scotch,
Belgrade/Max Lange or Glek/King's Indian facsimiles.} -- (6... -- {Old is New:
-- The Four Knights, once the darling of past legends like Tarrasch,
Capablanca, and many of the top players in the period between 1850 and 1925,
went stale after that and was essentially a discarded opening, pushed aside by
the Lopez. In the 1980s, GM John Nunn revived the opening as a newly-honed old
weapon. He showed through his games that the Four Knights' stodgy reputation
was undeserved and untrue by winning many sharp games with it. Today, the Four
Knights fits in the repertoire of many of the top players in the world,
including Carlsen, Shirov, Radjabov, Ivanchuk, Glek and many other super-GMs.
It has finally gained respectability and is now considered the other Lopez.}) (
6... -- {The Format of the Book: -- If this is your first experience of the
Move by Move format, then let me explain. The book is designed as a series of
chess lessons. We begin each game with a question-and-answer format, mostly
during the opening theory phase. Then we switch to middlegame and endgame
exercises. This book is not just a standard issue opening theory volume. It is
also a middlegame/endgame interactive workshop. Since the book is designed as
a series of lessons, the format is casual.}) (6... -- {Acknowledgements: --

throughout this book and all the others. Thanks to Nancy, CEO of proof reading,
and thanks to Timothy, staunch ally in my eternal war against all things
high-tech. --- Good luck with the Four Knights. May your opponents raise their
eyes toward the ceiling in exasperation as they observe you moving your second
knight out! --- Cyrus Lakdawala, San Diego, April 2012.}) *

choice versus the computer. Humans still edge out computers in the realm of
tedium.} dxc6 7. d3 Qe7 {The first glitch appears.} (7... Nd7 {
, allowing for ...f6 later on, is the more accurate move.}) 8. Ne2 {QUESTION: It looks to me like White is playing scared, isn't he? --- ANSWER: I would also
be cautious against an opponent who calculates thousands of moves per second.
White's last move, far from passive, plans a transfer to g3 in Lopez fashion.
In fact, White is in essence playing the Black side of this variation, but a
move up since he is White.} Bg4 (8... Nh5 9. Ng3 Nf4 {was J.Rosito-A.Sorin,

Unimpressive. The position is blocked for now so this doesn't constitute any
kind of plus for Black.} Be6 {EXERCISE: Black just offered us his e-pawn.

14... f6 15. Be3 {QUESTION: Offering a swap of White's good bishop for Black's
bad bishop? --- ANSWER: True, but White also followed the principle stating:

to come up with a concrete plan of action to improve his position. White hopes
to set in motion a minority attack with h4 and g5, but how to implement it?
--- ANSWER:} 20. Kg3 $1 {We humans still dominate silicon if the fight
remains within the framework of the conceptual rather than the mathematical.
I'm impressed if you predicted this move! --- Step 1: Larsen plans a kingside
minority attack soon with h4 and g5. By playing his king to g3, he covers his
g4-pawn. He also leaves options open for Rh1 to take over the h-file if
necessary.} Qa5 $6 {Oh, the sweet innocence. Deep B fails to realize its king
is in danger and makes an aimless move. Black, playing without will, simply
drifts. As Terminator Arnold once observed, "Desire is irrelevant. I am a
machine."} 21. h4 $1 {Step 2: The minority attack begins: g5 is coming.} Qc3 ({

piece sac and managed to spill a problem on our lap. Should we accept the
piece or plough forward with our attack, with24gxh6?} 24. cxb3 $5 {In the end
his works out well for White but I have my doubts about this decision.} ({

must still answer for past deeds, even if redeemed in the present. Black's
energetic but speculative bishop sac doesn't fully make up for its aimless
play earlier in the game. At the moment Deep Blue has collected four pawns for

and right.} 30. Rd5 Ra3 31. Rxe5 g4 32. Kxg4 {
White is happy to add his king into the attack.} c4 {EXERCISE (planning): Even
though it is an ending Black's king remains unsafe with so many white pieces
milling about in that zone. Come up with a plan of attack. --- ANSWER:} 33.
Rd2 $1 {Take control of the seventh rank. --- QUESTION: Isn't White nervous
about Black's surging c-pawn? --- ANSWER: No, speed is of the essence and the
c-pawn isn't fast enough. Mate arrives first. A bull may be larger and possess
greater physical strength than a horse but it still gets beaten in a race.}
Rxa4 (33... c3 34. Rd7 Rxa4 35. Ree7 {is no better for Black.}) 34. Rd7 Rc8 35.
Ng5 Ra2 {EXERCISE (combination alert): Black's king clings to survival with
tenuous fingers and the back rank is not so secure. How to exploit these
factors? --- ANSWER: Play for tricks on the back rank:} 36. Rxc7 $1 {
Game over. Now the three angry bull mastiffs approach Black's king.} Ra8 37. g3
Rf2 38. Ree7 Kh8 {This poor guy is a bug in a sealed jar.} 39. Rxg7 Rh2 40. e5
Rd8 41. Rh7+ Rxh7 42. Nxh7 Rg8+ 43. Ng5 {. Black's terminally ill king thinks
to himself, "Please, just a little more time!" A creature already dead is
incapable of dying, and it is always such a relief for the human race when the
Terminator's red eyes grow dim and then go black. --- Summary: The 6 Bxc6 line
proves very difficult to beat and is a perfect choice against a tactically
oriented or higher-rated opponent.} 1-0

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bb5 Bb4 {. Welcome to the other Ruy Lopez,
the Symmetrical Four Knights Spanish. We force Black into a Lopez-like
position, but deprive him of his Lopez theoretical knowledge and also a tempo.
--- When I was young, penniless, thin and handsome, I recall many a dismal
chess tournament breakfast. All I could afford was a cup of tea and a bland
bowl of oatmeal. I could do no more than peer with longing at the six-course
breakfast consumed by the guy at the next table. With the Symmetrical Four
Knights Spanish the same fate befalls Black. We deprive our booked-up Ruy
Lopez expert his pancakes, eggs, hash browns and fruit, and instead hand him a
lukewarm bowl of mush and order him to eat it - and like it! In the opening,
our options are a form of wealth. When Black enters this line we bankrupt his
options, forcing him to enter and play what is given him. --- People
accustomed to power - and I place the super booked up Black side of the Lopez
players firmly in this category - don't take kindly to refusal. Most players
as Black don't want to endure symmetry a move down, so they normally go for
the Unpin line, shown after} 5. O-O O-O 6. d3 Bxc3 7. bxc3 d6 8. Bg5 Qe7 9. Re1

, which makes Black's life rather miserable in what is essentially his only
logical way to play for the win. Carefully study Cheparinov-Jakovenko and
Radjabov-Amin to get a glimpse of Black's anguish in this main line.} *

{I believe it was the many-time British Champion Sir George Thomas who once
lamented the trying experience of facing Capa. Thomas said at a certain point
in the game, you saw exactly how Capa would beat you, but there was nothing
you could do about it! Could Thomas have been talking about this game?} 1. e4

Spanish, Symmetrical Variation. Prepare for a heavy duty manoeuvring game,
similar to the Ruy Lopez. --- QUESTION: Why not play the Ruy Lopez as White?
--- ANSWER: The Ruy is a terrific opening, just so long as you possess a
photographic memory! You must deal with myriad lines like the Marshall Gambit,
Breyer, Chigorin, and a million other lines, as well as their subsets. The
benefit of the Symmetrical Four Knights Spanish is that we corner Black into a
Lopez-like position where we only need to study a few positions, all with the

ones.} 9. Re1 {QUESTION: What does the rook do on e1 except stare at his own

d2 and posting it on c1? --- ANSWER: Well, for a start, d2 is still

easier for Black to force central resolution to the pawn tension.} Rd8 {

very slightly: -- 1. His bishop looks better than its counterpart on g6. -- 2.
Black's d-pawn is artificially isolated. -- 3. White controls the c-file but
more importantly the c5-square, where a rook can be lifted over to attack. --
4. The opposite-coloured bishops would favour the attack, but in this case
neither side has anything going. Yet White is the only one who can build with

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bb5 Nd4 {. We enter our most theoretically
challenging chapter in the entire book. The hair trigger lines of the
Rubinstein Gambit - our version of the Ruy Lopez Marshall Gambit - run sharp
as deceit. In each case, Black offers his e5-pawn, often with future
generosity to follow. The time taken to grab the pawn gives our opponents a
development lead and Marshall Gambit-like attack/initiative as compensation.
In a chess game, one's wealth isn't always measured in scarcity or abundance
of material. In this instance, we are rich in pawns while Black's wealth is
his piece activity. It is our job to master this line to the point where we
snatch our opponents' pawns and then slowly learn to unravel and take the air
out of their initiative and attack. When we reach this glorious moment, it
will feel similar to when Rocky Balboa cried out "Adrian!" --- This isn't a
chapter where we can wing it and play intuitively. We must memorize and
thoroughly understand our defensive plans. One great advantage of the Four
Knights Rubinstein Spanish over the Ruy Lopez Marshall Gambit is that Black
doesn't face the Four Knights Spanish nearly as often as he does the Ruy Lopez.
So it is quite likely that we will be more booked up than our opponents.} *

has a double attack on c3 with queen and bishop. --- QUESTION: So if Black

you find the Four Knights Spanish theoretically daunting, or just prefer a
more open game, then you may want to look into this chapter as an alternative
or a secondary weapon. If you choose this line as your main weapon, you will

Scotch. --- QUESTION: Why play an imitation when we can play the real Scotch
Game? --- ANSWER: For practical reasons. The Scotch is a theoretically
dangerous game. By playing the Four Knights Scotch, we narrow and limit
Black's choices, in turn making our study that much easier. Kasparov lost his
world title to Kramnik mainly because he failed to dent Kramnik's Berlin Lopez.
When Kasparov was asked why he didn't try the Scotch as an alternative, he
answered that White was deeply vulnerable to opening prep in the Scotch Game.

QUESTION: What are the differences? --- ANSWER: -- 1. Black hopes to prevent

Normally Black plays ...c6 and then only much later tries for ...c5, which
constitutes a loss of a tempo. One idea behind ...Be6 is to play ...c5 in one
go, saving a move. --- QUESTION: Both ideas sound logical. Why isn't ...Be6
the main line over ...c6? --- ANSWER: One problem with the bishop's placement
on e6 is that he commits early to that square and loses options of ...Bg4, ...Bf5 or ...Bb7 later on, unless he wants to lose time. A second issue is that
the bishop on e6 is vulnerable to Ne2-f4, or, f4-f5 ideas from White.} 11. Ne2

with unfortunate results. --- QUESTION: Why didn't Black pin our knight? ---
ANSWER: As we saw in previous games, ...Bxc3+ isn't much of a threat since we
always get good play with our bishop pair. So Black reasons that if this is so,
then why not play the bishop to the active c5-square? --- QUESTION: That
sounds very logical. So why isn't playing to c5 a better move than the pin?
--- ANSWER: For one very important reason: when Black pins our knight and then
later plays ...d5, we must exchange on d5, helping Black. In the version with
Black's bishop on c5 and then ...d5, White may retain the tension with Bg5 and
Re1.} 6. Nxc6 (6. Be3 {, Pinski's choice, is considered the main line, which
we won't cover in the book. --- QUESTION: Why not? --- ANSWER: We take on c6

Black allowed the long diagonal to open based on the principle: Counter in the
centre when attacked on the wing. In this case Mamed is his own worst enemy,

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. d4 exd4 5. Nd5 {. Welcome to a hallucinatory
no-man's land where normal rules cease to apply - also known as the Belgrade
Gambit. When I first began this book I had no intention of putting in a
chapter on the Belgrade Gambit, which I then regarded as an opening of dubious
parentage and an assault to logic. At about this time at a tournament, a 2300+
friend told me he tended to lose when he faced the Belgrade, mainly due to his
frantic attempts to bust the gambit. What? This is a line which most titled
players claim is refuted! That was enough for me to reverse course and insert
this chapter in the book. The opening may even turn out to be sound, mainly
thanks to the pioneering work of my friend, Bruce Monson, an IM-strength
correspondence player and advocate for his beloved gambit. What I discovered
when researching the line is that not every gamble ends in ruin, nor does each
adventure end in death. The gambit appeals less to our intellect than it does
to our fighting spirit and gambler's instinct within. So if you are the kind
of person who gets tempted to fly a kite in a hurricane, then you may want to
consider the Belgrade Gambit as a must-win, surprise weapon in your opening
arsenal.} *

} 3... Bb4 {, the independent Four Knights Petroff, in Chapter Eight.}) 4. d4
exd4 5. Nd5 {Let the chaos begin. --- QUESTION: What is this? --- ANSWER: We
just entered the theoretically disreputable Belgrade Gambit. --- QUESTION:
When you say "disreputable" do you mean unsound? --- ANSWER: I wouldn't
characterize it as unsound, but it may lurk in the vicinity! Titled players
have said many mean and hurtful things about the Belgrade Gambit. Paul Motwani
says the following: "The Belgrade Gambit is potentially tricky for an
unsuspecting opponent but objectively speaking, this gambit is rather dubious.
" --- QUESTION: So why even look at it? --- ANSWER: First, I am not so
convinced it is a bad line. Second, The Belgrade Gambit is also quite a
dangerous ambush weapon which is not such a bad thing in your opening arsenal
if you are desperate for a win. Just think of the Belgrade as the deranged
cousin to the Max Lange Attack. --- A 2300+ rated friend confided in me that
he always loses to the Belgrade Gambit because he meets it so rarely. When he
actually encounters it he always forgets his analysis and goes bonkers trying
to bust it! --- QUESTION: What is the point of White's last move? --- ANSWER:
Some ideas behind the gambit: -- 1. Black must be careful of Bg5 ideas. -- 2.
If Black takes on d5 White's e-pawn recaptures, disrupting Black. -- 3. White
offers his e-pawn but as we will see later in the chapter, there is always a
risk for Black if he takes it. -- 4. The gambit is disorienting and has a way
of removing Black from his theoretical comfort zone.} Be7 {Considered the safe
response. Black doesn't want any part of the chaos and strives to reach a safe,
equal middlegame. Morozevich grants the Belgrade Gambit respect - something
most of your opponents will refuse to do! Something to think about: If the
Belgrade Gambit were truly unsound, don't you think a player of Morozevich's
strength and theoretical prowess would have banged out the refutation?} ({

ambush weapon and especially suited to fast time controls or overly positional,
unbooked opponents.} 1/2-1/2

its strange way, an action nonetheless. With the Glek Variation, a niche line

part: Continue the symmetry and the slightly uncomfortable present; or try and
complicate, with its hidden intimation of danger. --- The Glek Variation, much

foe as easily as a hero's weapon. The move is passive but not so bad. With 4...d6 Black has a choice of two plans: -- 1. He can play his bishop to e7. When
White plays d4 later on Black takes and uses the little centre strategy. -- 2.

is doltishly easy to play and therefore far more suited to a math/attack-challenged guy like me. I have never been a good calculator in situations with
multiple branches, and I know my limitations: Ask me to count to ten and I may
be able to pull it off without the assistance of fingers. However, if you ask
me to count to 20, I may be forced to resort to taking off shoes and socks to
accomplish the goal! --- In essence White can go after a pawn in a simple line
or go after a much bigger prize, Black's king, in a much more complex line.

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nc3 Bb4 {. When my son, Tim, was very young and
misbehaved, and if my wife and I ever threatened to take away his toy, then
that very toy immediately became his heart's desire. This chapter is something
like that. The loyal Petroff player refuses to give up his toy and veer away
from his beloved opening into our realm of the Four Knights, insisting on
remaining in the Petroff - even if his opening is not so great against 3 Nc3.
Black plays a price for his loyalty. In reply to 3...Bb4 we simply take his
e5-pawn and then watch Black squirm and accept concessions to win it back. In
a few moves, this is what we get:} 4. Nxe5 O-O 5. Be2 Re8 6. Nd3 Bxc3 7. dxc3
Nxe4 8. Nf4 {. In the end we normally get the bishop pair and a slight space
advantage after c3-c4. Not the end of the world for Black, but he ends up in a
lifeless position where only White gets any realistic winning chances. --- In
the final two games of the chapter we also look at other third moves for Black.

one on f6. --- QUESTION: How does this change matter? --- ANSWER: We are

reasons why this one favours White: -- 1. When White takes the e-pawn and then
later retreats his knight, he doesn't have to go to d3 as he would in the

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nc3 d5 $6 {Black, in a foul mood, picks a fight with
his much larger GM opponent. --- QUESTION: Why do you think this move is
dubious? --- ANSWER: We arrive at an upside down, North-is-South moment. How
can the side down a move rightfully hope to grab the initiative on move three?
Black breaks the principle: Avoid confrontation when lagging in development.}
4. exd5 Nxd5 $6 {Black, like Santa's elves, churns out a gift for White.} ({
QUESTION: Isn't} 4... e4 {better? It looks like Black may regain his pawn and
boot us around at the same time. --- ANSWER: The move you suggest is better

10... Rd8 $5 {Castling queenside is a more natural move.} 11. O-O Nd4 {
EXERCISE (critical decision): Black ploughs forward and offers his bishop on
e6. If we take it he plays ...Nf3+ winning our queen. Should we give up our
queen or not?---} {ANSWER: We should. White gets a glut of material for it:}

Life is full of such disappointments. Now Black's forces, a shadow of their
former selves, look in the mirror and see strangers in the reflection. ---
Summary: If 3...d5 worked, then Black would stand better on move one! The line
proves to be unproductive, barren land, unsuitable for human habitation.} 1-0
