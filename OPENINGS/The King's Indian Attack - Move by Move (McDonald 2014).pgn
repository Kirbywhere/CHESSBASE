{This series provides an ideal platform to study chess openings. By
continually challenging the reader to answer probing questions throughout the
book, the Move by Move format greatly encourages the learning and practising
of vital skills just as much as the traditional assimilation of opening
knowledge. --- Carefully selected questions and answers are designed to keep
you actively involved and allow you to monitor your progress as you learn.
This is an excellent way to study any chess opening and at the same time
improve your general chess skills and knowledge. --- The King's Indian Attack
is a very popular system of development for White, which can be used against
many defences. It's easy to learn and play, and is based on understanding
ideas rather than move memorization. The King's Indian Attack usually involves
a deliberate and sustained attack on the black king, which often proves to be
highly effective and difficult to defend against. In this book Grandmaster
Neil McDonald examines in depth the many variations of the King's Indian
Attack. He outlines White's most promising options and Black's best defences,
and provides answers to all the key questions.} 1. Nf3 d5 2. g3 Nf6 3. Bg2 e6

{The King's Indian Attack (or KIA) is a flexible opening system that can be
employed by White after 1 Nf3 or against the French, Sicilian, and Caro-Kann
if he chooses to begin with 1 e4.} 1. -- ({The King's Indian Attack (or KIA)
is a flexible opening system that can be employed by White after 1 Nf3 or
against the French, Sicilian, and Caro-Kann if he chooses to begin with 1 e4.} 
1. Nf3 d5 2. g3 Nf6 3. Bg2 e6 4. O-O c5 5. d3 Nc6 6. Nbd2 Be7 7. e4 O-O) ({
while the same position could be reached via a Sicilian or French move order
after for example} 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d3 Nc6 4. g3 d5 5. Nbd2 Nf6 6. Bg2 Be7
7. O-O O-O {. The characteristic features of the King's Indian Attack are the
fianchetto of the bishop on g2 and the setting up of a d3 and e4 pawn chain.
White will develop his pieces in support of the strongpoint on e4. --- In the
King's Indian Attack there is no immediate clash between the two armies. Both
sides are on the whole left undisturbed during the opening phase: only when
White threatens to encroach on space in the centre does the game begin to
develop its individual character. For this reason it is possible to describe
the typical piece and pawn deployments by White and Black without becoming
bogged down in detail or having to point out too many exceptions.}) ({As we
see in the example above, the two sequences that begin with 1 Nf3 or 1 e4
could well transpose into each other. However, this isn't always the case.
Whether to start 1 e4 or 1 Nf3 is the eternal dilemma of the King's Indian
Attack player. If you play 1 e4 you aren't guaranteed to get a KIA opening
system: for example, after 1 e4 d5 there's no good way to maintain a pawn on
e4. This lack of universality might make you veer towards 1 Nf3. Here a
possible drawback compared to 1 e4 is that you have to face the solid Slav
line after} 1. Nf3 d5 2. g3 c6 {in which Black puts his bishop on f5 or g4 in
the near future. Facing the Dutch after 1 Nf3 f5 might also not appeal to some
players.}) ({I have standardized the move order in the games for the sake of
clarity. However, I should mention that there are other ways besides 1 e4 and
1 Nf3 to reach the familiar KIA set-up. For example, Nakamura played} 1. g3 $5
{in his game with Navara in this book. That's probably the ultimate in
flexibility, though of course if he chooses Black can avoid the KIA with} e5 {
. --- The power to force the opponent into an opening scheme that you have
carefully worked out is an advantageous use of the white pieces, even if
objectively speaking it is about equal. I hope this book helps you understand
the King's Indian Attack and that you win many games with it.}) (1. -- {Neil
McDonald, Gravesend, May 2014}) *

1. -- ({Fischer's old favourite: The King's Indian Attack (KIA) has the honour
of being the first game in Bobby Fischer's 'My 60 Memorable Games'. The US
Maestro remarks of the position after} 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d3 {: "This used
to be my favourite at the time [of his game with James Sherwin, New Jersey
1957]. I thought it led to a favourable variation of the King's Indian
reversed, particularly after Black has committed himself with ...e7-e6." ---
Of course, Fischer went on to become a massive openings expert after 3 d4 in
the Sicilian and the rest is history. However, for those of us with less time 
(not to mention originality and genius), when it comes to the study of the
opening phase, the King's Indian Attack remains an especially effective choice
once Black has played ...e7-e6. In fact, some very strong players only have
the KIA in their repertoire after 1 e4 e6 or 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6.}) ({Black's
committal ...e7-e6 move: QUESTION: Why is} 1. e4 e6 2. Nf3 c5) ({or} 1. e4 c5
2. Nf3 e6 {so committal?}) ({ANSWER: We need only compare the situation with
that after} 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d3 {. The move ...e6 is committal in that
firstly it shuts in the bishop on c8, thereby limiting the chances of
generating counterplay with ...Bg4. As a consequence there will be less
pressure on White's centre. In fact developing the bishop to any reasonable
square will take time and effort. --- Secondly, if Black responds to the KIA
by building a centre with ...d6 and ...e5 he has lost a tempo by having to
move the e-pawn twice. And, thirdly, the move ...e6 has loosened Black's
centre somewhat. After the alternative 2...d6 3 d3 he can just get on with
developing his kingside with ...Nf6, ...g7-g6, and ...Bg7, thereby not
weakening his dark squares.}) ({Black doesn't fianchetto on g7 in this chapter:
Whether Black answers 1 e4 with 1...e6 or 1...c5 there is a strong possibility
that an identical position will be reached after a few moves. Technically
speaking, we might say something like "the game started as a French, but
transposed into a Sicilian set-up" or vice versa. For the sake of clarity, in
this chapter we look at lines in which Black plays his pawns to e6 and d5
versus the King's Indian Attack (KIA), and puts his dark-squared bishop on e7,
d6 or even c5 according to circumstances. In the next chapter we look at all
variations in which Black puts a pawn on c5 and fianchettoes the bishop on g7
- he may play the French ...e6 move as part of the process or he may avoid it,
preferring ...d6 for example. --- This means that if Black begins the game
with the moves} 1. e4 e6 ({or} 1... c5 2. Nf3 e6) 2. Nf3 c5 3. d3 Nc6 4. g3 g6
5. Bg2 Bg7 6. O-O Nge7 {you need to look for this set-up in Chapter Two.}) ({
An important note on move order: If variety is the spice of life, then the
King's Indian Attack is very rich in experiences. Its basic structure can be
reached through all sorts of move orders, with 1 g3, for example, being the
way the first game in this chapter started. --- Black has more flexibility in
the French specific move order than in the Sicilian move order. For example,
after} 1. e4 e6 2. d3 d5 3. Nd2 Nf6 {if White plays the natural} 4. Ngf3 {the
reply} ({suffice to say here that I've tweaked the move order in the French
line so that after 3...Nf6 White plays} 4. g3 {straightaway. Then} c5 5. Bg2
Nc6 6. Ngf3 Be7 {reaches the standard position}) 4... Bc5 {is a real nuisance
if you want to fianchetto on g2. The reason why this is so will be explained
in the analysis to 3 Qe2 in Game 6. --- Of course if the game has started with
1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6 3 d3 then the idea of ...Bc5 is never an issue - there is a
pawn on c5 stopping the bishop going to the square.}) *

{After} 1. e4 e6 2. d3 d5 {White can support his pawn on e4 with either 3 Nd2
or 3 Qe2. Both are equally good moves, with advantages and drawbacks relative
to each other. Thus putting the knight on d2 is a valuable developing move,
while leaving it on b1 for a while gives an additional attacking option in the
main line if Black castles queenside. On e2 the queen not only defends e4, she
supports an e4-e5 thrust, but she might also become a target of a ...Ba6 move
in the future (that is, if Black plays ...d5xe4; d3xe4 b6 and ...Ba6 as in
Game 7).} 3. -- ({In Part One we examine the main line with} 3. Nd2 {, when

make. Should he castle kingside or play} b6 {to fianchetto his queen's bishop,
which is normally followed by queenside castling?}) ({The subject of Part Two

Rather than straightforward development with} 5... Nf6 {and 6...Be7, Black

features variations in which Black plays (in either order as appropriate) ...d5xe4 and ...e6-e5 to equalize the space balance. This approach is possible
against both the 3 Nd2 and 3 Qe2 scenarios, and so they are discussed together

{Part One - The main line with 3 Nd2:} 1. e4 ({The move order in the game was
actually} 1. g3 d5 2. Bg2 Nf6 3. Nf3 e6 4. O-O Be7 5. d3 O-O 6. Nbd2 c5 7. e4
Nc6 8. Re1 {.}) 1... e6 2. d3 {QUESTION: is it necessary to play this quiet
pawn move so early?} ({ANSWER: We have to take measures against an attack on
the e4 point at once if we wish to play the main line of the King's Indian
Attack against the French move order. After} 2. Nf3 d5 {, for example, it's
too late to revert to} 3. d3 {as} dxe4 4. dxe4 Qxd1+ {is an unwelcome exchange
of queens.}) ({The only real alternative is} 2. Qe2 {which is mentioned in the
notes to Game 7 below.}) 2... d5 3. Nd2 {QUESTION: I guess everyone plays this
move? White develops a piece and avoids the queen exchange after 3...dxe4. ---
ANSWER: Yes, 3 Nd2 is very natural.} ({But as a matter of fact, lots of
players prefer} 3. Qe2 {. The knight move has the drawback that it shuts in
the bishop on c1 and deprives White of certain attacking ideas that are
discussed in Part Two.}) 3... Nf6 4. g3 {Now White clears the way to develop
his bishop to g2. A kingside fianchetto is the trademark of the King's Indian
Attack. It is more promising than putting the bishop on e2 where it would be
shut in by its own pawn on d3. As we shall see, the bishop has an important
aggressive/defensive role on g2.} ({QUESTION: But isn't} 4. Ngf3 {more normal
first? --- ANSWER: As explained in the introduction above, White is keen to
avoid} Bc5 $5 {when the fianchetto on g2 becomes problematical. Hence he
starts with 4 g3 - a completely valid move order.}) 4... c5 {Black gains space
and increases his influence over the d4-square which White has declined to
occupy with a pawn.} ({He could instead play} 4... Bc5 {which is analysed in
the notes to 3 Qe2 in Game 6.}) 5. Bg2 Nc6 6. Ngf3 Be7 7. O-O {White now has
his basic King's Indian Attack deployment, which he will adopt against various
Black set-ups. It's fair to say you can't go too far wrong if you stick to
these moves as White.} O-O {A critical moment which will define the middlegame
strategy.} ({Black has a major alternative in} 7... b6 {which could well lead
to him castling queenside - see Game Three.}) 8. Re1 ({Putting the rook on e1
immediately seems slightly more flexible than} 8. e5 {.}) 8... Qc7 {Trying to
oppose the e4-e5 advance only loses time. He should have advanced his
queenside pawns immediately, as occurs in Game 2.} 9. Qe2 b5 10. e5 {QUESTION:
What are the advantages and possible dangers for White in advancing the pawn
to e5? --- ANSWER: White's pawn is very well protected on e4, whereas it will
have many enemies on e5 - after Black's reply his queen and two knights are
eyeing it malevolently. The black pawns might also play a part in the demise
of the e5-pawn. For example, White has to be certain that the pawn can't be
dissolved in a way unfavourable to him by a future ...f7-f6, or that the
knight on f3, the staunch defender of the pawn, can't be undermined by a ...g5-g4 pawn lunge. --- Here Hillarp Persson has taken adequate precautions to
ensure that the pawn won't get eaten on e5 by the black pieces: his queen,
rook and knight on f3 are all defending it, and as we shall see, the bishop on
c1 will also soon play a part in guarding it. Thanks to 11 h4 next move, and
the fact that the black king is on g8, a plan to undermine the knight on f3
with ...g5-g4 would not be feasible. Nor could Black realistically hope to
arrange ...f7-f6 in a way that didn't leave him with a weak pawn on e6. So
much for the safety of the pawn. Its value in advancing to e5 is that it
drives the black knight away from f6, its best square, and fixes White's space
advantage on the kingside. Having more space basically means that your pieces
have more room to manoeuvre than the opponent's pieces, as your pawns don't
get in the way so much. White is able to use the extra squares to bunch all
his minor pieces together on the f-file and g-files, where they become a
formidable attacking force. Once the energy of the white pieces reaches a
certain level, we see another role for the e-pawn: a support for possible
sacrifices on f6.} Nd7 11. h4 {EXERCISE: Can you think of a couple of reasons
why this is a good move? --- ANSWER: White is planning a kingside attack. With
11 h4 he: 1) Clears the h2-square for the knight on d2, allowing it to join in
the assault with the sequence Nf1, Nh2 and Ng4. --- 2) Creates a base on g5
for his other knight on f3, making possible an attack with Ng5 and Qh5. --- 3)
Prepares the further advance h5-h6, when ...g7-g6 leaves Black with weak dark
squares around his king. --- In scenarios where Black has left his king in the
centre, or castled queenside, the move h2-h4 is often useful to restrain a
possible ...g7-g5 flank attack by Black, especially if White has a bishop on
f4 which can be hit by the advancing black pawn. You will see examples of this
in Games 3 and 4. Of course, having castled with 7...0-0 in this game it is
doubtful that the plan of ...g7-g5 would do anything other than wreck the
black king's defences.} a5 12. Nf1 Re8 13. Bf4 Ba6 14. Ne3 {QUESTION: What
happens now if Black plays 14...b4 to continue his queenside advance? And,
secondly, can he capture the pawn that's hanging on e5?} Nb6 {The black knight
has been dragged over to b6 to defend d5, but now it is unavailable to defend
the kingside. That means that our knight manoeuvre to g4 becomes more powerful.
If we had played 14 N1h2 the knight could have stayed on d7 and helped defend
the king with ...Nf8 in the future.} ({ANSWER: On his last move White could
have played 14 N1h2 and then 15 Ng4, but it's better to combine the
implementation of a strategic plan with a tactical threat. This is because the
opponent has to lose time dealing with the threat - or even better, he might
miss it. After 14 Ne3, let's see about} 14... b4 {:} 15. Nxd5 $1 exd5 16. e6 {
(uncovering an attack on the black queen)} Qb7 {and now we have to avoid the
routine recapture on d7. --- Instead,} 17. exf7+ $1 Kxf7 18. Qe6+ Kf8 19. Ng5
$1 {(threatening mate on both f7 and h7)} Bxg5 20. Bd6+ {and Black is

the queen as well as mate on e7 (or g8, due to the double pin on d7 and e7)})
21. Bxd5 {and mate follows on f7 or g8. In these variations we see the triumph
of White's light-squared bishop.}) ({We also have to consider what happens if
Black grabs the pawn on e5:} 14... Ndxe5 15. Nxe5 Nxe5 16. Nxd5 $1 exd5 17.
Qxe5 Qxe5 18. Bxe5 {and Black has no good way to defend the d5-pawn.} -- ({. If

curious that in this sequence Black has the choice of losing a pawn on the
queenside, in the centre or on the kingside. Such is the global nature of
White's pressure. --- QUESTION: Well, those variations would have taken me a
lot of effort to work out during the game. I don't like leaving the e5-pawn
hanging. And in any case, Black didn't fall for the traps, did he? I might
have settled for the simple 14 N1h2. --- ANSWER: But if you want to be a good
player you can't duck calculating variations. There won't always be a safe
move like 14 N1h2 available; you need to get into the calculating habit. And
besides, Black didn't fall for either traps, but look what he played to
prevent them.} (21. --))) 15. Ng4 b4 {EXERCISE: What's the way to add energy
to our kingside attack?} 16. Qd2 $5 {Sometimes an elegant little sideways
shuffle by the queen can be more effective than overtly aggressive moves. Here
she takes up position on the dark-squared diagonal. On the other hand, good
old fashioned aggression is still effective.} ({ANSWER:} 16. Nf6+ $1 {when if}

similar to the game, and I don't want to give away the answers to some of the
questions that follow).}) 5. Bg2 Nc6 6. Ngf3 Be7 7. O-O b6 {In contrast to the
games above, Black neither commits himself to castling kingside nor gets his
queenside pawns rolling. --- EXERCISE: Can you see the idea behind pushing the
pawn to b6?} 8. Re1 {The most flexible move. White keeps his opponent guessing
for one more move about his intentions with the e-pawn. --- ANSWER: With 7...b6 Black cleared the way to develop his bishop and kept his queenside pawns in
a compact mass as he is planning to castle queenside. He reasons that White's
build-up is designed for an assault on the kingside, so by whisking the king
off to c8 he will be denying White the main object of his attack. He also
hopes that he might obtain counterattacking chances against the white king.}
Bb7 9. e5 Nd7 10. c4 $5 {QUESTION: Can you suggest some of the ideas behind
this move?} ({ANSWER: White could continue his build-up in support of the e5

with d3-d4. So play might continue} O-O {when White can adopt his usual
kingside deployment with moves like} 12. h4 {and 13 Bf4.}) ({. If Black plays} 
10... Qc7 {then} 11. cxd5 exd5 12. d4 $1 {more or less knocks the idea of
castling queenside on the head.} -- ({. If} 12... cxd4 $6 13. Nb3 {it would be
very risky for Black to grab the pawn on e5 as White has Bf4 with a huge
initiative (just ask the king on e8 what it thinks of the opening of lines in

very good chances for White.})) 10... d4 {EXERCISE: In the game Black pushed
the pawn to d4, which is the obvious reply as it keeps the centre closed. But
why is the white knight on d2 delighted? --- ANSWER: In contrast to the lines
of the first two games in which the knight was sent on a convoluted manoeuvre
via f1 and h2 or e3 to g4, here it already has an excellent centre post on e4
in its sights. Of course, White has to make sure its occupation of e4 is
compatible with the safety of the e5-pawn, but as we shall see, Chigaev will
soon solve that problem. --- QUESTION: Does White now have a useful move?} 11.
h4 $1 {ANSWER: At first glance it might look somewhat odd to play this pawn
advance when there is no black king on g8 to attack. However, it is a more of
a preventive move than an aggressive thrust. Now that the centre is blocked,
if allowed Black might have essayed 11...g5, a positionally well-motivated
sally as it threatens 12...g4, embarrassing the knight which is the defender
of the key e5 point. White therefore puts the g5-square under lock and key, as
11...g5?! would now be feeble after 12 hxg5, removing the battering ram.} h6 {
EXERCISE: Black renews the threat of 12...g5. How should White respond and
what is the reasoning behind the move?} 12. h5 $1 {With the white pawn on h4
Black would in some scenarios be prepared to play ...g7-g5 to open lines
against the white king even if he lost a pawn in the process (of course, Black
would call it 'a sacrifice' not losing a pawn). However, if 12...g6 now then
after 13 hxg6 fxg6 there would be no open g-file or h-file for the black rooks
and the pawn on e6 would be sickly. If White attacked it with Bh3 the response
...Nf8 would interfere with the coordination of the black pieces. Black
doesn't want to weaken his centre in this fashion. --- The only way for Black
to revive the idea of the pawn thrust is to play ...0-0-0, ...Rdg8 and then ...g7-g6,
so that h5xg6 could be answered by ...Rxg6 (note that if Black played ...g7-g5, rather than ...g7-g6, White would probably leave the pawn on h5 and
try to get in the blockading move Ng4). --- Another feature in White's favour
about the h5 and ...h6 pawn configuration is that it makes it less appealing
for Black to change his mind and castle kingside. With the black king on g8,
White could revert to the manoeuvre Nf1, Nh2 and Ng4 when options to sacrifice
on h6 would appear. Black therefore has fewer strategic options after 11...h6
and 12 h5.} Qc7 13. a3 {White always has to make full use of his wing pawns in
the King's Indian Attack. He is anticipating a future ...0-0-0 by Black and so
limbering up for a b2-b4 pawn stab.} a5 ({Judging from his vigorous play in
the rest of the game, it is likely Maksim Chigaev would have sacrificed a pawn
to open lines straightaway after} 13... O-O-O {with} 14. b4 $5 {.}) 14. b3 {
QUESTION: What's this? You've just told me White is an aggressive player and
now he plays this passive move. --- ANSWER: You can't play chess well unless
you can combine energy with patience. Don't forget that Black hasn't castled
queenside yet, and if permitted could have clamped down on White's queenside
pawns with 14...a4! in the same way that White has stopped Black's kingside
advance with h4-h5. Then any attempt to break open lines with b2-b4 could have
been neutralized with ...a4xb3 en passant, depriving White of the b-pawn
battering ram.} ({In contrast, after} 14. b3 {, White could answer} a4 $2 {with
} 15. b4 $1 {, keeping his pawns alive as there is no en passant capture.})
14... O-O-O {At last Rindlisbacher commits his king to the queenside.} 15. Ne4
f5 {Black decides to get rid of the knight from e4 as quickly as possible. He
must have feared ideas such as 16 Bf4 and a well-timed Nd6+, perhaps in
conjunction with a b3-b4 breakthrough.} ({White would get strong pressure on
the light squares after} 15... Ndxe5 16. Nxe5 -- (16... Nxe5 17. Bf4 f6 18. Bh3
$1 {(this move is often a star in the KIA)} Qd7 19. Bxe5 fxe5 20. Qg4 {, etc.})

Nb5 {both the black king and queen are awkwardly placed}) 18. Qxe1 dxc3 19. Bf4
Rxd3 {with unclear play. In reality, Black would have to be a top player to
have any chance of finding the queen sacrifice. The move 16...Qxe5 looks
incredibly risky and White has other ideas like 17 Bf4 to dissuade Black from
chancing it.})) 16. exf6 gxf6 {QUESTION: How should White handle the changed
centre structure? What's the best move? --- ANSWER:} 17. Ned2 $1 {A fine
retreat. If Black responds with 17...e5 then his pawns have no way to expand
any further as the light squares e4 and f5 would be in White's hands after 18
Nh4 or 18 Bh3. As Nimzowitsch has taught us, a pawn structure that has no
capacity to expand becomes a target, with the squares it cannot expand to 
(here e4 and f5) becoming especially strong posts for the enemy pieces. Any
strong player would fight his utmost to avoid having to play 17...e5 in this
position. Hence Rindlisbacher decides to retreat his own knight to f8.} Nf8 ({
QUESTION: Would Black have better luck with} 17... Nde5 {. --- ANSWER: The
problem is that after 17...Nde5 White can snuffle out Black's activity when
the fragility of his centre tells after} 18. Nxe5 Nxe5 19. Nf3 {(White is
happy to swap off pieces if it exposes e6 and f6 to attack)} Bd6 20. Nxe5 {and

rook on h8 into the fray with} 23... Rh7 {.}) 24. c5 $5 {Played with the
enterprise of youth.} ({Being old and tired I would probably play} 24. Ne4 {
and then 25 Nh4 and 26 Nf5 if possible to take the light squares, but the

possible, and does so splendidly.}) 24... Bxc5 ({After} 24... bxc5 {one method
of attack is} 25. Ne4 {intending 26 Nh4, 27 Rc2 and 28 Rxb4.}) 25. Nc4 Bd5 $2 {

entrance by the KIA bishop. The pin on e6 ensures that c5 falls.} Kd7 30. Rxc5

develops as in Game 3 above, but with White having played Qe2 rather than Nbd2.
As we shall see, tarrying with the knight on b1 gives White a potent extra
attacking resource if he chooses to avoid the c2-c4 strike on Black's centre.}
({It is rather unappealing for Black to fianchetto on g7 when White hasn't
committed his knight to d2. Firstly, this is because it is slightly awkward to
arrange when White has the option of e4xd5 and, secondly, because White's
dark-squared bishop has open access to the c1-h6 diagonal where it is
worryingly near the dark square holes created by g7-g6. For example,} 3... c5

e4-square for his knight and, by strengthening the c4 point with b2-b3 if
necessary, block any attempt by Black at queenside counterplay. Meanwhile

to play Bf4: he doesn't want the bishop to become a target for a counterattack

keeps the bishop observing the g5-square from a distance, meaning that if
appropriate he can lop the pawn off it goes to g5. --- Compared to 3 Nd2,
where the white knight ends up on f1, here the horse is still in touch with
the queenside. It goes to a3, forcing Black to think about the danger from the
Nb5 thrust. The knight can also drop back from a3 to c2 (hence the value of 10
c3), and support a pawn advance with b2-b4 which will endanger the black king

Black. You could imagine 13 Bf4 being followed by the manoeuvre Nc2, Ne3 and
Ng4. White would have to ensure that Black couldn't respond ...Nxe5 in a
favourable way when the white knight reached e3, but this shouldn't be at all
difficult because the black knight would be pinned on e5 against his queen.}

feed pieces over to the attack: for example,} 15. Bf4 a5 16. Ne3 $1 {, which
is even better than 16 Nh2 and 17 Ng4. Why shouldn't the queen's knight be
allowed to join in the fun as well? Besides in some cases the sacrifice Nxd5,
to answer ...exd5 with e5-e6 and a discovered attack on the black queen, might
be on. White will be able to play 17 Ng4 next move when sacrifices on h6 or
even with Nf6+ will be in the air. --- By the way, don't believe the
assessment of a computer program in positions of this kind. It might tell you
that Black is doing fine, but a human player is more than likely to crumble
when he sees his kingside denuded of defenders and sacrifices looming on h6.

piece after} 17. Nxe5 Nxe5 18. d4 {.}) 15. a4 {Notice how White uses his
h-pawn and then his a-pawn to cause trouble for the black king. In the King's
Indian Attack the centre is often blocked or static for a long time. Therefore
you need to have complete mastery over the wing pawns, whether it's supporting
the advance of the b-pawn with a2-a3, denying the black knight or bishop the
g4-square with h2-h3, or advancing the pawns aggressively as here.} Na5 {Black

be dislodged by an enemy pawn.} ({Instead} 20. d4 $2 {would be a fundamental
mistake. Black wouldn't achieve any counterplay with ...c4xd3, rather it would

the g1-a7 diagonal for a possible infiltration by his queen.}) ({Instead,} 20.

{Bologan increases his control of the dark squares. The opposition of queens
along the g1-a7 diagonal is very unpleasant for Black. Already he must watch

}) 2. Nf3 e6 3. d3 $1 {Grandmaster Matthew Sadler was one of England's most
promising young chess stars, but he ceased being a professional player in 1999.
His last ever game as a professional was for your author's team, Invicta
Knights, in a European Club Cup match. It was a fine hurrah as Sadler beat
Alexander Morozevich with Black in a sharp Sicilian Najdorf. Matthew returned
to chess after a long hiatus in 2010 and continued to perform way over 2600
level. But when chess is only your 'hobby' you can't keep up with all the
sharpest opening theory. When it comes to ducking main lines, the King's
Indian Attack is just what is needed.} Nc6 4. g3 d5 5. Nbd2 Bd6 {Note that
this move would be difficult to arrange against the 3 Qe2 move order, as White
would be in a position to play e4-e5 more quickly, or else the fact that ...Bd6 could be answered by e4xd5, winning a pawn due to the pin on the e-file,
would scupper the plan. Former World Champion Anatoly Karpov was a fan of this
bishop deployment (just imagine the diagram position being contested in a
match between Fischer, a fan of the KIA, and Karpov in 1975).} ({EXERCISE:
Would you like to weigh up the pros and cons of having the bishop on d6
compared to after, say,} 5... g6 6. Bg2 Bg7 7. O-O Nge7 {? Hopefully you'll be
able to weigh up these options better after you've read Chapter Two, but have
a go here. --- ANSWER: With 5...Bd6 the bishop is brought to the centre fight
in one move (5...Bd6), rather than two (5...g6 and 6...Bg7). Black avoids
loosening his kingside dark squares with ...g7-g6 and keeps the bishop in
contact with the c5-square and the queenside in general. A bishop on g7,
especially if shut in by e4-e5, can lose touch with events on the queenside.
--- On the other hand, the bishop will be less safe on d6 than on g7 and is
only contesting control of one square on the a1-h8 diagonal rather than the
whole of it. Furthermore, White might gain time for his e4-e5 advance by
hitting the bishop.}) 6. Bg2 {QUESTION: Now what square should the black
knight on g8 be developed to: e7 or f6? --- ANSWER:} Nge7 ({After} 6... Nf6 {
Black would risk having both his knight and bishop on d6 driven back by an
e4-e5 advance (and he wouldn't have the option of stabilising the centre with ...f7-f6 with the knight on that square). Therefore he chooses a safer and more
permanent address for the horse.}) 7. O-O O-O 8. Re1 {Sadler's development is

There's more to development than getting the pieces off the first rank. Indeed,
after} 9. b3 d4 $1 {you have to ask yourself if you are planning to develop or

{White is now ready for the advance e4-e5 as it can now be supported by d3-d4
in the event of Black attacking it with ...Ng6.} Rb8 {The rook not only
supports a pawn thrust against c3 with ...b5-b4, but is also evacuated from
the a8-h1 diagonal where it could be exposed to attack after Black's 11th move.

needs another string to his bow besides the e4-e5 advance.}) ({The alternative

effective if White switches to the alternative 11 e5. --- In other words,
Black is able to counter both 10 e5 and the plan of attacking c5 with b2-b4,
but can't use the same pawn move against plans. White manages to exploit this
by first feinting to play 11 b4 and then switching to 11 e5.}) 10... b5 11. e5
{QUESTION: Why shouldn't White attack c5 with 11 b4 as he did against 11...b6
in the variation above?} ({ANSWER: Black could answer} 11. b4 {with} c4 $1 {,
avoiding weaknesses on the queenside. As explained above, the drawback to 10...b5 is that Black can no longer activate the bishop with ...Ba6 in response to
11 e5.}) 11... d4 {Black cuts off the potential support of the e5-pawn with
d3-d4, but now the c5-pawn becomes a target once again. The bishop on g2 is

Nxc5 Nd7 {Black prefers to exchange off the active knight on c5 rather than
the one on f3. White's advantage is minimal. He has a little queenside
pressure because Black's pawn on b5 is a target, but that is all.} 15. Ne4 Bb7

this natural move also the best one?} ({ANSWER: Chess is also about stopping
your opponent playing good moves. I like the way Emanuel Lasker describes the
purpose of a chess move in his book Common Sense in Chess. A move either: a)
Develops something or brings new forces into the game. --- b) Makes your own
pieces do something, such as attacking something. --- c) Serves a defensive
purpose, that is, undoing the work of the opponent's pieces. --- As we shall
see, White is planning 16 a4 which will clear a diagonal for his bishop on a3

clashed in their favourite opening. --- The present game was played at blitz

as pride being an incentive to win. Therefore I doubt that either player would
have purposely played a second-rate opening to hide their best ideas in the
King's Indian Attack. In fact, Morozevich might have prepared the pawn
sacrifice with 13...Ne7 at home - perhaps he feared facing it as White. Play

O-O 9. c3 {EXERCISE: Can you think of two reasons for this move, and how Black
should respond to it? --- ANSWER:} a5 {With 9 c3 White guarded the d4-square
and threatened to expand on the queenside with 10 b4. Gaining space in this
manner would be pleasant for White in any case, but here it would have the
added bonus of hampering the defence of the e5-pawn after a further b4-b5.
Therefore Black very sensibly prevents it - see the analysis game.} 10. Rd1 {
EXERCISE: Having seen the Maslak game, can you explain why White plays this
move? What is his plan?} Qe7 {ANSWER: White played 10 Rd1 to take the queen,
of course. A more strategical response is that the rook will be well stationed
on the only open file on the board. We also know from the Maslak game that
White is beginning to fight for the d5-square. Finally, if you answered "Why,
in six moves' time the rook is going to take the pawn on a5" then either you
have cheated or you have psychic powers.} 11. Bg5 {Bologan decides to exchange
off the piece defending the d5-square. As we saw in the Maslak game, he is
willing to invest the bishop-pair to achieve his aim: something of a risk
against an attacking player like Morozevich.} h6 12. Bxf6 Qxf6 {The next step
in White's plan will be to get his knight to c4.} 13. Nbd2 Ne7 ({A solid
alternative is} 13... b6 {. The game C.Bauer-E.Fernandez Romero, Elgoibar 2005,
continued} 14. Nf1 ({if} 14. Nc4 {the pin with} Ba6 {is unpleasant, so the
knight must seek a different route to d5}) 14... Ba6 15. Qc2 Rfd8 {. ---
EXERCISE: If now} 16. Ne3 {Black can lop off the knight with the bishop and
double White's pawns. See if you can find a good way to prepare the knight
move.} ({ANSWER:} 16. a3 $3 {. Success in the King's Indian Attack often
depends on little pawn moves. The plan is 17 b4, chasing the bishop from c5
when 18 Ne3 heads for the fine post on d5. --- If now} b5 $2 {clearing a
retreat for the bishop back to b6, 17 b4 leaves the other bishop on a6 is shut
in.} ({Therefore Black can only maintain the bishop on c5 with} 16... a4 {. At
first glance this seems an attractive idea, but the pawn became vulnerable
after White swapped everything off into an endgame with} 17. Rxd8+ Rxd8 18. Rd1

your eyes open for this move in the KIA)} c6 24. Bd7 {. After} g6 25. Ke2 Kg7
26. Ne1 {White had a couple of small advantages: his king is nearer the centre,
the black pawns on a4 and c6 are loose, and White's bishop has more scope than
Black's which is impeded by the pawn on e5. Are these enough to win?
Objectively no, but Bauer managed to grind out a win thanks to excellent
technique, persistence and his opponent's impatience. Here, for example, Black
needlessly weakened his pawns further with} f5 {when} 27. f3 Kf6 28. Nd3 {was
uncomfortable for him.}))) 14. Nc4 Ng6 {Having transferred his own horse to g6
where it guards the e5-pawn, Morozevich plans to keep the white knight out of
d5 by answering 15 Ne3 with 15...c6. Therefore Bologan has to act fast or any
advantage will evaporate. --- EXERCISE: Can you guess what he might have
played? --- ANSWER:} 15. Rd5 $1 {As in the Maslak game, Black's manoeuvre to
fortify the d5-square has left something vulnerable in his queenside pawn
structure. The rook invades just in time before Black slams the door shut with
15...c6. Now either a5 or e5 is going to drop, but Morozevich hopes to cause
problems for White's rook.} Ba7 ({Black removes the bishop from the c5-square

{Here I wish to pause and consider the similar scenario reached after the
alternative 3 Nd2 move order by White. We'll refer to another game by the
Moldovan Grandmaster, V.Bologan-K.Maslak, Budva 2009, which went (with the
move order amended for consistency):} 1. e4 e6 2. d3 d5 3. Nd2 Nf6 4. g3 Nc6 5.
Bg2 dxe4 6. dxe4 e5 7. Ngf3 Bc5 8. O-O O-O 9. c3 a5 {. The only possible sharp
alternative I'd like to point out is that if instead of 9...a5, Black tries to
stifle White with 9...Qd3, the queen can be evicted by 10 Ne1 and then 11 b4,
when White gains space on the queenside to make up for the inconvenience
caused by the white knight going back to e1. --- Maslak has adopted the same
plan as Morozevich did versus 3 Qe2 and the game has flowed in similar style.
--- EXERCISE: Perhaps you would like to compare the two positions from
Bologan's games and consider what difference it makes that White has his queen
on e2 in the first, and his knight on d2 in the second? --- ANSWER: Generally
speaking we can say that in both scenarios Black's king is completely safe and
he has been able to develop his pieces to active centre squares. There are no
obvious weaknesses in his pawn structure. Meanwhile White has been restrained
from advancing on the queenside and there are no entry points for his pieces
along the d-file. It would be reckless to try to 'take Black whole' on the
kingside by preparing f2-f4, as the most likely outcome would be the collapse
of the white centre: the black pieces are just too active. --- QUESTION: So
what is Bologan to do? Is it time to offer a draw? --- ANSWER: Actually, there
is a glimmer of hope for White: he has managed to guard the d4-square with his
c3-pawn, whereas Black is unable to respond with ...c7-c6 to cover the
d5-square. Therefore, in both scenarios a plan suggests itself: get a knight
to a splendid post on d5. --- Let's see how Bologan utilized the d5-square in
the Maslak game (from the diagram above with the white queen on d1):} 10. Qc2 {
We might say that c2 is a somewhat superior square to e2 for the white queen,
as there is no chance of being attacked by ...b7-b6 and ...Ba6. Though it also
has to be said the white queen never comes under any such pressure in
Bologan's game with Morozevich.} b6 11. Nb3 {The knight drives back the bishop
from c5 and clears the way for his own dark-squared bishop to enter the game.
The one drawback to the b3 post is that it is much further away from d5 than
the knight would be after Nc4.} Be7 ({After} 11... Bd6 {the knight on f6 can
be pinned with Bg5.}) 12. Rd1 {The first white piece to get into contact with
the d5-square.} Qe8 13. a4 {Stopping his knight being driven back by 13...a4.}
Ba6 ({After} 13... Be6 {White would probably continue as in the game, since}
14. Ng5 Bd7 {leaves the horse no one near d5.}) 14. Nh4 $1 {The knight heads
for a strong outpost on f5 (though not as good as d5).} Rd8 ({If} 14... g6 $2 {
to guard f5 then} 15. Bh6 {wins the exchange.}) 15. Be3 {White dangles the
prize of the bishop-pair before Black's eyes as he sees it will facilitate
getting the horse to d5.} Ng4 16. Nf5 Nxe3 17. Nxe3 Rxd1+ 18. Rxd1 Qc8 19. Nd5
{The knight finally makes it to the dream square. Now Black rather helpfully
allows the other knight to get to the c4-square from where it can also get in
contact with d5:} Bd8 20. Nd2 Be2 21. Re1 Bg4 22. Nc4 Be6 23. Qe2 f6 24. h4 Be7
25. Nce3 Bc5 26. Qb5 $1 {A clever probing move. The black queen goes to b7,
after which White retreats his queen back to f1, with ideas of Bh3.} Qb7 27.
Qf1 Nd8 28. Nc2 ({Instead,} 28. b4 {looks the way to keep the initiative.})

the fragility of Black's queenside after the loosening move ...c7-c6.} 29. Nde3
Qc8 ({Black misses his one chance to obstruct White's attack with} 29... Bb3 $1
{. This possibility is why White should have preferred 28 b4.}) 30. b4 $1 {Now
all is well again for White's plan as he can open lines to exploit the
vulnerable black queenside.} Bxe3 31. Nxe3 Nf7 32. Rb1 Qa8 {The pressure on
the black queenside, which can be traced back to the plan of Nd5, distracts
the black queen so that White can seize the light squares with his next move.}

avoided material loss but now there are threats to his king with Nf5 looming.}

lacks the defensive resources to protect the c5-pawn.} 38. Qe6+ Kh8 39. Qc4 {

{"Almost everyone plays 3 d4. But isn't that a positional error? I am not
joking. I like my centre pawns, and I like a d-pawn better than a c-pawn. Well
then, isn't 3 d4 something like a cheap trap? I know it can be combined with
purely strategical ideas, but I find it easier to discuss strategy when I have
an extra centre pawn!" - Bent Larsen, 'How to Open a Chess Game' --- I think
the great Danish Grandmaster would have approved of the King's Indian Attack.
White doesn't try to exploit the advantage of moving first by launching an
immediate assault on the black position. Instead he builds up his centre
position carefully. When violence is inflicted on Black (and there is a lot of
it in the KIA), it is all the more devastating because it comes from a solid
positional base. --- In this chapter we are going to examine games in which
after} 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 {Black plays 2...Nc6, 2...d6, or 2...e6 and combines it
with ...g7-g6 and Bg7. Games in which Black develops his king's bishop to e7,
d6 or even c5 usually occur after 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 e6 and these have been
subsumed into Chapter One under move orders such as 1 e4 e6 2 d3 d5 3 Nd2 Nf6
4 g3 c5 or 1 e4 e6 2 d3 d5 3 Nd2 c5 4 Ngf3 Nc6 5 g3 Bd6, etc. For Black's
fianchetto when White has played an early Qe2 rather than Nbd2, see the notes
in Game 4 in Chapter One.} -- ({Black's fundamental choice: Black has two ways
of gaining space in the centre, or more precisely of preventing his opponent
from seizing more territory. He can either prepare a pawn advance to e5 or
else to d5. His choice mainly depends whether he has committed himself to} 2...
d6) ({or} 2... e6 {. With the pawn on d6, ...e7-e5 suggests itself; with the
pawn on e6, the advance ...d7-d5 is natural. These two ideas are looked at in
Part One and Part Two respectively.}) ({The alternative} 2... Nc6 {doesn't
commit Black to either advance, and so can be used as part of either set-up.})

centre position, but White can build up a space advantage on the queenside

restrain d3-d4, namely} 8... Bg4 {. He hopes that giving up the bishop-pair
after} 9. h3 Bxf3 10. Qxf3 {is a price worth paying to restrain the white

{Part One - Black arranges a pawn advance to e5:} 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 {It looks
like it's going to be a Sicilian main line, but now White swerves aside.} 3. g3
$1 {QUESTION: Why is this rather than 3 d3 the best way to start White's
build-up? --- ANSWER: A key idea for White is to build a centre with c2-c3 and
then d2-d4. So committing the pawn to d3 lessens White's options and takes the
pressure off Black somewhat. On the other hand, if 2...e6, then 3 d3 to
strengthen e4 in anticipation of ...d7-d5 seems best. Likewise if 2...Nc6, I
would suggest 3 d3 to fend off future ...d7-d5 ideas. OK, I know that Black
could then revert to a ...d7-d6 style opening line, but I'd prefer that to
having to learn what to do after 2...Nc6 3 g3 d5 - it might not be that
wonderful for Black, but it would take us out of our repertoire.} Nc6 4. Bg2
Nf6 5. d3 {Only now that the e-pawn is attacked does White commit his pawn to
d3.} g6 $1 {Not seeing any future for his bishop other than on g7, Black
prepares to develop it to an excellent diagonal.} 6. O-O Bg7 {Black has chosen
a 'Dragon' set-up with his pieces and pawns well entrenched in the centre and
controlling some useful dark squares.} 7. c3 ({EXERCISE: This little pawn move
is preferred in the King's Indian Attack to the developing} 7. Nc3 {, which
would bring us into Closed Sicilian territory. Can you think of some reasons
for choosing the pawn move? --- ANSWER: If you have read the introduction
above and the note to 3 g3 you will understand the value of 7 c3. White
reduces the range of the bishop on g7 and takes away the d4-square as an
operational base for the black knight on c6. As an exaggerated example of the
value of this preventive idea, if we play} O-O {and then let White make the
careless move} 8. Qe2 $6 {after} Bg4 {, intending 9...Nd4, things are already
somewhat awkward for him. --- However, the strategic crux of the matter is
that 7 c3 can support a space-gaining pawn advance, either in the centre with
d3-d4 or on the queenside with a2-a3 and b2-b4. If White can advance d3-d4
without being punished he will have built a pawn centre of the kind he never
achieves in the Sicilian main line, where after 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 d6 3 d4 his
centre is permanently kept half size by 3...cxd4 - see the Larsen quotation
that began this chapter.}) 7... O-O ({QUESTION: Why not} 7... c4 {to break up
White's pawns? --- ANSWER: The pawns don't remain broken up for long after} 8.
dxc4 Nxe4 9. Nd4 $1 {when the knight dare not move from e4 because of 10 Nxc6.
After} Nxd4 10. cxd4 Nf6 {White has a good game due to the open diagonal for
his bishop and potential pressure down the e-file. --- Note that 7...c4 fails
for tactical reasons: if it wasn't for White's vigorous response it might have
been a good strategic idea. So don't allow your opponent to play a ...c5-c4-style move
if it can't be punished.}) 8. Re1 {Now there won't be any ...c5-c4 move as e4 is defended.} (8. Re1 {. EXERCISE: So far Black has been able
to make straightforward developing moves, but now he has to come up with a
counter to White's positional threat of seizing a pleasant space advantage

do you think is the most annoying for White?} -- ({. ANSWER: First of all,} 
8... Bg4 $5 {pins the knight} 9. -- ({, so that White's immediate centre

Bxa8 Rxa8 14. Rd1 Nd5 ({if} 14... c4 15. a4 $1 {looks a good reply, as} bxa4 ({

Kf1 {, etc.}) ({. Back at move 11, White could decline the exchange and just
build up in the centre with natural moves: for example,} 11. Qe2 Rb8 12. a3 a5
13. Nd2 a4 14. Nf3 Nd7 15. Be3 Qb6 16. Rad1 {. In summary, after 8...Bg4 Black
has taken the sting out of d3-d4 by exchanging off his only minor piece that
can't fight for the dark squares. On the other hand, White has the two bishops
and the chance to improve his position. A small advantage of this kind is all
we're looking for in the King's Indian Attack.}))) ({. Black's second option is
} 8... e6 {. The idea is to allow White to advance d3-d4, but block the centre
in the style of the French Defence, when Black is well entrenched on the light
squares. Nonetheless, this strategy looks unattractive, as White gets to seize
space on the kingside and drive the black knight from f6. The white rook is
well placed on e1 to support the spearhead on e5. A possible sequence is} 9. d4
cxd4 10. cxd4 d5 11. e5 Ne4 12. Nbd2 Nxd2 13. Bxd2 Qb6 14. Bc3 Bd7 15. h4 f6
16. exf6 Bxf6 17. Qd2 Rae8 18. Rad1 Qc7 19. Ng5 $1 {and White had the
initiative in E.Vorobiov-G.Nigalidze, Rijeka 2010. --- So, 8...Bg4 looks a
good idea, 8...e6 a poor one, and as for 8...e5, well, that occurred in our
main game.})) 8... e5 $5 {The critical response. Black equalizes space on the
e-file, and has more advanced pawns in the centre as a whole. In the Ruy Lopez,
Black often increases the size of his centre with ...c7-c5: for example, with
the laboured manoeuvre ...Na5 and ...c7-c5 in the Chigorin. Here he has
already achieved ...c7-c5. --- Black has no weaknesses on the kingside, which
is heavily fortified. The preparation of the advance f2-f4 is unappealing for
White; besides his rook would be better for this task on f1. Nor is d3-d4 a
promising option - it would bring Black's bishop on g7 back into the game
after the response ...e5xd4 and ...Bg4. --- QUESTION: It seems Black's pieces
are poised to take advantage of loosening moves such as d3-d4 or f2-f4. How
can White launch an attack without waking the beast on g7? --- ANSWER:} 9. a3
$1 {White prepares b2-b4. --- QUESTION: Why would this be a strong pawn
advance? --- ANSWER: The value of b2-b4 is: 1) The b2-square is cleared for
the white bishop, whence it can support the strategically desirable d3-d4
advance and oppose the black bishop on g7. --- 2) After b2-b4, the exchange ...c5xb4 and a3xb4 is unattractive for Black as it reduces the size of his centre
and opens up files and diagonals for the white pieces on the queenside.
However, if Black avoids this exchange, he won't be able to arrange a freeing ...d6-d5 advance without leaving the c5-pawn hanging. --- 3) The pawn advance
opens up the option of b4-b5, driving the black knight from its strong central
square. It would be offside on a5 and with few options on e7. The removal of
the black knight facilitates the plan of d3-d4, as the knight would no longer
have influence over this square. There would also be extra pressure on the
e5-pawn if it was no longer defended by the black horse.} ({EXERCISE: Assess
the pros and cons of the position for both sides if Black plays the immediate} 
9. a3 d5 {to conquer more space in the centre and the game continues} 10. exd5
Nxd5 {. --- ANSWER: After 9...d5 10 exd5 Nxd5 the features associated with
advantage for Black are: the greater space afforded by having pawns on c5 and
e5, the excellently placed knight on d5, and the chance to attack White's
backward pawn on d3, say with ...Bf5. --- On the other hand, 10 exd5 would
open up the h1-a8 diagonal for White's bishop, his rook on e1 and knight on f3
get to attack e5, and the pressure can be increased with Nd2 and Nc4. Moreover,
the white queen could even add to the pressure on d5 from b3. The black knight
is well placed on d5, but is also an object of attack. --- White also has the
chance to activate his dark-squared bishop after the loosening of the dark
square barrier: for example, he could play Bg5, to provoke the weakening ...f7-f6, followed by a retreat back to d2; or, in some cases instead of Bg5, he
could try Be3, attacking c5, if Black no longer has the option of ...Nxe3.
Black's bishop on g7 is doing a great job bolstering the kingside, but its
absence from the defence of the queenside makes the c5-pawn slight vulnerable.}
) ({QUESTION: What happens if Black stops the queenside expansion with} 9. a3
a5 {? --- ANSWER: White can respond to 9...a5 with} 10. a4 $1 {. He is
certainly getting full value out of the a-pawn as it now incapacitates the
black queenside pawns as an attacking force by stopping ...b7-b5. It also
secures a post at c4 or even b5 (not quite so good, however, as that's further
from the centre) for the knight on b1, either of which can be accessed with
Na3.}) 9... b5 $5 {Black mobilizes his queenside pawns at once.} ({He prevents
a future b4-b5 by blocking the b5-square, so that} 9... b5 10. b4 {is now well
answered by} a5 $1 {when White can't maintain a pawn on b4. Then} 11. bxc5 dxc5
12. Be3 Qe7 {looks at least OK for Black.}) 10. h3 {QUESTION: Why does White
make a puny looking pawn move on the kingside when the battle is raging on the
queenside? --- ANSWER: White wants to advance d3-d4. He secures his knight's
role in this plan by ruling out ...Bg4, and he ensures that Be3 is possible
without being attacked by ...Ng4 - an exchange with ...Nxe3 would be unwelcome.
Sometimes little moves are vital links in the chain of a chess strategy.} Rb8
11. Be3 {So White's bishop never got to b2 after all. On the other hand, 9...
b5 means that the pawn on c5 can't be defended by ...b7-b6 any longer. Without
the moves 9 a3 and 9...b5 thrown in, Black would be able to respond 11...b6
and then 12...d5, gaining space in the centre when 13 exd5 Nxd5, planning to
exchange the bishop on e3, looks good for him. --- Notice how the
inconsequential looking wing moves of the pawns - 9 a3 and 10 h3 - are
essential parts of White's plan.} a5 {Before White played Be3, the move b2-b4
could always be answered by ...a7-a5, not conceding any ground on the
queenside; but with the bishop on e3, this would lose a pawn to bxc5. Not
wishing to be forced to defend the c5-pawn by ...Qe7, Black rules out the
b2-b4 move. Besides, he is happy to gain more space.} 12. Nbd2 {EXERCISE:
White is limbering up for d3-d4. Any suggestions about the best way for Black
to reduce the impact of this move?} Be6 {Putting the bishop on e6 is hardly
discouraging a white advance in the centre.} ({ANSWER: Black might have
stabilized his queenside structure with} 12... a4 $5 13. d4 c4 {. If now} 14.
d5 $6 {Black has either} Na5 {, with the idea of invading on b3 with the
knight,} ({or else} 14... Ne7 {, followed by ...f7-f5 (after clearing the
f6-square of course and suitable preparation, such as ...h7-h6 to prevent Ng5
which would otherwise threaten to invade on e6 after ...f7-f5 has weakened the
square). Things could then get unpleasant for White's bishop on e3 with ...f5-f4 looming. So White should keep the centre dynamic with, say, 14 Qc2 and
14 Rad1. Perhaps he could prepare to advance his own f-pawn at some point to
increase the size of his centre with say Nh2 and f2-f4. --- I guess that
psychologically speaking, Black found it hard to block up the queenside,
especially as he has played his rook to b8 only a couple of moves earlier.}))
13. d4 {Thanks to his opponent's over routine 10th move White achieves the d4
advance in a favourable way. The threat of 14 d5, not to mention the
twice-attacked pawn on c5, persuades Black to liquidate on d4, when he is left
with the worse pawn structure in the shape of the backward and isolated pawn
on d6.} cxd4 14. cxd4 exd4 15. Nxd4 Nxd4 16. Bxd4 Qd7 {QUESTION: how should
White deal with the threat to his h-pawn? --- ANSWER:} 17. Qf3 $1 ({Ruinous is
} 17. Kh2 $2 Ng4+ 18. hxg4 Bxg4 {depriving him of his vital dark-squared
bishop and leaving both b2 and g4 hanging.}) ({Weakening are both} 17. g4) ({
and} 17. h4 {; in the latter case Black has acquired the g4-square for his
knight and could try for counterplay with} Bh3 {.}) ({Black may have
overlooked the strength of} 17. Qf3 $1 {when he allowed 13 d4. He stays on the
defensive as f6 hangs and the exchange of dark-squared bishops after} Nh5 ({or
} 17... Ne8 {would leave his kingside weak. --- Note that White is happy to
swap his important dark-squared bishop for its black counterpart, whereas
exchanging it for the black knight in the variation above with 17 Kh2? Ng4+
would be anathema to him. In King's Indian style set-ups there is a clear
hierarchy of minor pieces: Black's bishop on g7 is at the top, White's
dark-squared bishop is a little below it, and neither of these pieces wants to
be exchanged for a 'lower order' knight.})) 17... Qe7 18. Nb3 $1 {White finds
a clever way to simplify the position and so emphasise the superiority of his
pawn structure.} a4 19. Na5 Qc7 ({After} 19... Rbc8 20. Rac1 {the threat of 21

against d6 with threats to the black king, as there are a lot of loose dark

queen) is far away trying to drum up queenside counterplay.} Rc8 24. Rad1 Rc2
25. Qf4 b4 ({Black gets his queen back in touch with events in the centre, as

Black unleashing the bishop on g7 to help restrain d3-d4.} 12. Nd2 {White has
to develop his queenside, but now the c3 point is less well defended, which
provokes the b7-pawn into rushing forward.} b5 13. Rec1 {QUESTION: The white
rook goes to a passive square. What is White trying to do? Has he given up on
preparing the pawn advance d3-d4? --- ANSWER: White's plan for the moment is
simply to survive his opponent's blitzkrieg along the h8-a1 diagonal without
making any big concession in position or dropping material. He still plans to
expand with d3-d4 after very careful preparation, when he hopes that his long
term advantage of the two bishops will be of more importance than Black's 
(temporary) activity.} b4 14. Qd1 {EXERCISE: Can you see a couple of reasons
why this queen retreat is a good idea? --- ANSWER: In general it's good to
have the queen back in touch with the queenside as that is the scene of action.
On d1 she is also well placed to support a future d3-d4 advance. More
specifically, with his next move Black was intending to infiltrate with ...Na4,
when both b2 and c3 would be under attack. The queen retreat has pre-empted
that very dangerous idea by controlling a4.} Nb6 15. a3 $1 {Another
prophylactic move. White undermines the b4-pawn before Black could start
another wave of attack with ...a7-a5, planning to advance the pawn all the way
to a3 if allowed to wreck the white defences on the long diagonal.} bxc3 $2 {

was nonetheless the natural move, keeping the black pawn chain intact after}
16. axb4 axb4 {.}) 16. bxc3 Rb8 17. a4 $1 {QUESTION: Why is this a good move
for White? --- ANSWER: Nimzowitsch once said that a move on the wings with
thoughts on the centre was the highest nature of positional chess. Parligras
is now in a dilemma, as he doesn't want his knight kicked back by 18 a5, but
nor does he want to play 17...a5 as the pawn could become a liability on a5.}
Na5 {Black therefore elects to block the pawn's path with his knight. Here,
however, it no longer helps restrain the d3-d4 move. The tide is gradually
turning in White's favour.} 18. Rab1 {There should be no hurry to play d3-d4
as the black knights can then invade on c4. So first of all White plays the
rook to b1 with ideas of a future queenside expansion with 19 Rb5 Nc6 20 a5,
etc.} Nd7 {The knight runs away after which White finally achieves his long
desired advance in the centre.} 19. d4 Qc7 {EXERCISE: How does White tip the
energy balance on the queenside in his favour? --- ANSWER:} 20. Bf1 $1 {Note
that if Black had kept his knight on 6 at move 18 then White would have played
19 Bf1! as a prelude to 20 d4, when the black knights would have been kept out
of c4. --- The bishop retreat to f1 is often game-changing in the King's
Indian Attack. Here it gets involved in the queenside action, turning the
battle in White's favour. It rules out any invasion by a black knight with ...Nc4 in the future and prepares to go to b5 to increase the queenside pressure.
Meanwhile the celebrated 'Dragon' bishop on g7 remains mute.} Rxb1 21. Rxb1 Rb8
22. Rxb8+ Qxb8 23. Bb5 Qc7 24. Nb3 Nxb3 25. Qxb3 {EXERCISE: Who has benefited
most from the exchanges? How do you assess the position and what is White's
best plan? --- ANSWER: White is more than happy to have swapped off both pairs
of rooks and the knight on a5. After the clearance the energy missing from
Black's game due to the passive bishop on g7 becomes more significant.
Meanwhile obstacles facing the white pawn on a4 have been removed. It isn't a
passed pawn, but abetted by the two bishops it will become a major queening
threat. The bishop on e3 points ominously at the a7-pawn through the flimsy
cover of c5. If White could get his pawn to a6 and play Qb7 he would be close
to a win.} Nf6 26. Bd3 h5 27. Qb5 cxd4 28. cxd4 Qc8 ({After} 28... Nd7 {White

1. e4 ({The move order in the game was actually} 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. g3 g6
4. Bg2 Bg7 5. O-O d6 6. c3 e5 $1 7. d3 Nge7 {which made 6...e5! all the more
critical to stop 7 d4 'in one go'.}) 1... c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d3 g6 4. g3 Bg7 5.
Bg2 d6 6. c3 e5 $1 {QUESTION: Why does this move get an exclamation mark? ---
ANSWER: Firstly, it is in praise of the move itself which stops White gaining
space in the centre with 7 d4. And, secondly, I'm showing my admiration for
Black's very precise move order. Thanks to the fact that he has played 2...Nc6
rather than 2...e6, he is able to advance ...e7-e5 in 'one go' to stop White
from playing d2-d4. He has also avoided ...Nf6, so that his knight can slip
into the e7-square where it doesn't interfere with the restraining influence
of the bishop on g7 against d4.} 7. O-O Nge7 {Well, it's disappointing for
White to be a tempo down on a 'French move' order, but the good news is that
it is a quiet, manoeuvring game. --- EXERCISE: We've been stopped from
advancing in the centre, so how do we add some pawn power to our set-up? ---
ANSWER:} 8. a3 {Our standard plan of gaining space on the queenside. Our
queenside pawns can laugh fearlessly at the bishop on g7 that is stuck behind
the pawn on e5, which shows not everything is perfect about Black's set-up.} ({
The other way to inject some dynamism into our pawns was} 8. Be3 {, so that
after} O-O {White can make a beeline for an attack on the kingside with} 9. Nh4
{. However, I don't really believe in White's initiative and after} b6 10. f4
exf4 11. gxf4 d5 {, as played in the earlier B.Amin-E.Safarli,Tromso (rapid)
2013, I think Black is already at least equal due to White's fragile centre.
Besides, this type of rapid action (dare we say scrappy play?) isn't part of
the usual King's Indian Attack strategy. Like Bent Larsen in the quotation at
the start of the chapter, I feel that we should leave all the tactical tricks
to players who like 3 d4 versus the Sicilian. --- Incidentally, both the main
game and this excerpt were played between Bassem Amin and Eltaj Safarli in
their match in the FIDE World Cup in 2013. The main game was their sixth
encounter, the excerpt their third. Although Amin managed to win with 8 Be3,
it is perhaps significant that he later returned to 8 a3.}) 8... O-O 9. b4 h6 {
QUESTION: Why does Black plays this move? --- ANSWER: Black wants to put his
bishop on e6 without risk of it being attacked by Ng5, as to allow Nxe6 would
be a very poor swap of his important light-squared bishop for a knight. --- As
mentioned above, players of Black are prepared to reach this position a tempo
down after starting the game with an ...e7-e6 set-up: for example, 1 e4 c5 2
Nf3 e6 3 d3 Nc6 4 g3 g6 5 Bg2 Bg7 6 0-0 Nge7 7 Re1 0-0 8 c3 e5 9 a3 d6.} 10.
Nbd2 Be6 11. Nb3 $5 {A speciality of the Egyptian Grandmaster.} (11. Nb3 {.
EXERCISE: What is Black's best response? a) Defend the pawn with 11...b6. ---
b) Advance it with 11...c4. --- c) Play 11...Qd7 as 12 bxc5 Bxb3 13 Qxb3 dxc5
leaves d3 weak.} -- ({. ANSWER: Black tried} 11... Qd7 $2 {in B.Amin-E.Nekrasova, Dubai 2013. After} 12. bxc5 Bxb3 13. Qxb3 dxc5 {the white d3-pawn
may need to be defended, but why should White care about that minor
inconvenience when he has got the positional prize of exchanging his knight
for Black's light-squared bishop (see the note to 9...h6 above). After the
moves} 14. Rd1 Rac8 15. Be3 b6 16. h4 $1 {with ideas of 17 h5, and perhaps 17
Kh2 and 18 Bh3, Black's light squares were already looking shaky.}) ({.
Instead,} 11... b6 {is a solid response. Then B.Amin-S.Khader, Dubai 2005, went
} 12. Bb2 ({it was also possible to close the queenside at once with} 12. b5
Nb8 13. c4) 12... a5 {(Black decides to rule out any future white a-pawn
advances on the queenside)} 13. b5 Nb8 14. c4 Ra7 15. Nfd2 {and here an
interesting line would be} Nd7 16. Nc1 {(bringing the passive knight over to
the kingside)} f5 17. exf5 gxf5 18. Ne2 f4 {. Black might be overpressing as
after} 19. Nc3 {he has a formidable dark-square pawn chain, but there are also
light-square holes in his centre. --- After 11..b6 12 Bb2 Black could prevent
13 b5 with 12..a6 but then a slight weakness is created on b6 which White
could play against in the future with a regrouping such as Nbd2, Qe2, Rab1,
and Nc4 when appropriate. It is worth mentioning that despite White having his
bishop on b2 and two knights aimed at d4, the pawn advance d3-d4 is very
seldom a good idea for White - in fact most of the time it's terrible. --- The
third option is seen in the game. I think it is the best response, whereas 11...b6 isn't far behind, and 11...Qd7? is wheezing in the distance.})) 11... c4
12. dxc4 Bxc4 13. Re1 Qc7 14. Nfd2 {EXERCISE: The knight attacks the bishop,
but can you see any other reason for this move? --- ANSWER: The knight on d2
would like to get into contact with the hole in Black's centre on d5, which
would make a good outpost square for it. It can get there via f1 and e3.} Be6 {
QUESTION: What is the best way to activate the sleepy bishop on c1? --- ANSWER:
} 15. a4 {Amin clears the a3-square for the bishop.} a5 {Meanwhile Black wants
to create a strong point on c5 for his knights and so forces the white pawn
forwards.} 16. b5 Nb8 17. Ba3 {White gets his bishop to an active square.} ({
Now} 17. Ba3 Qxc3 $2 {would be crazy for Black as} 18. Bxd6 {would be a good
swap for White} ({and the immediate} 18. Rc1 {looks much stronger.})) 17... Nd7
18. Nf1 {Both sides pursue their manoeuvres with knights. White's horse heads
towards the d5-square, the black one to c5 to block the attack on d6.} Nc5 19.
Nxc5 dxc5 20. Ne3 {White has emerged with a small but lasting positional
advantage due to the gap in the black pawn structure on d5.} Rfd8 21. Qc2 {
QUESTION: Is there a good regrouping manoeuvre available to Black? --- ANSWER:}
Nc8 $1 {The knight heads for b6 where it will fight for control of c4 and also
attack the a4-pawn - this will be a nuisance for White as one of his rooks or
queen will have to keep an eye on the pawn. --- EXERCISE: How can White now
try to increase his grip on the centre light squares, and what should be
Black's response? --- ANSWER:} 22. Bf1 $1 {As so often in the KIA, the bishop
finds its best chances through retreating back to f1. Given the chance White
will play 23 Bc4 to more or less force the exchange of light-squared bishops.
Black doesn't want to be left with only a bishop shut in by its own pawns on
g7, and so he played:} c4 $1 {A vital move that reclaims the c4-square and
clears the way for ...Bf8 to exchange off the inactive bishop.} 23. Red1 Nb6 {
EXERCISE: Now Black is ready to exchange off his bishop with ...Bf8, how can
White return the compliment? --- ANSWER:} 24. Be2 {The bishop heads for g4.} ({
Black might have stopped it with} 24. Be2 h5 {, but either he thought the
slight weakening of his kingside was unnecessary as there was no longer
anything to fear in the exchange, or he considered that White's bishop would
be quite useful in any case after} 25. Bf3 {where it might support a future
Nd5.}) 24... Bf8 25. Bxf8 Kxf8 26. Bg4 Qe7 27. Bxe6 Qxe6 {The position looks
fairly equal, especially as the a4-pawn needs to be kept defended, but here
Amin came up with a neat little move.} 28. Qc1 $1 {Even Karpov, the master par
excellence of first-rank manoeuvres with the queen, would be proud of finding
this retreat. White plans to swing his rook via a2 to the centre, while the
indirect attack on h6-pawn through the white knight makes Safarli
uncomfortable.} h5 {So Black does play ...h6-h5 after all - see the comment to
24 Be2 above.} 29. Ra2 $1 Kg7 30. Rad2 $1 {Cleverly done: it turns out the
white pieces don't have to stay defending the a4-pawn.} Rxd2 31. Rxd2 {
QUESTION: So what does happen if the knight takes the pawn on a4?} Qe7 ({
ANSWER: The neat point is that} 31... Nxa4 {loss the knight to} 32. Qa3 $1 Nb6
33. Rd6 {.}) 32. Qd1 {Now the white queen defends a4 and empowers the rook
along the d-file.} Qa3 $2 ({It was better to go into heavy defence with} 32...
Rf8 {, when if} 33. Rd6 ({White could keep up the pressure with a slower move,
or even} 33. Nd5 Nxd5 34. Rxd5) 33... Nxa4 $1 {is suddenly a good move.}) 33.

After the exchange of queens Black has a close to winning advantage due to his
well-supported passed pawn.} 38. Rd1 ({White had a wonderful method of drawing
worthy of a study:} 38. Rd7 $1 a4 39. Rxf7+ Kg8 40. Rxb7 a3 41. Nd7 a2 42. Nf6+

has failed, but} 45. Rd7+ Kc8 46. b6 $3 {saves him as after} a1=Q 47. Rc7+ {

{Part Two - Black arranges a pawn advance to d5:} 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d3 Nc6
4. g3 {In Chapter One we saw Black build up from this structure with moves
like ...d7-d5, ...Nf6 and ...Be7. Here we'll look at an alternative
development of the bishop to g7. A fianchetto is eminently logical for Black
in this set-up. The pawn on c5 is likely to remain on the board a long time,
so it makes sense to invest a tempo in getting the bishop to a more active
diagonal. On g7 it will be safe from attack and influencing central squares.}
g6 5. Bg2 Bg7 6. O-O Nge7 {EXERCISE: A secondary consequence of the fianchetto
on g7 is that Black's knight is often developed to e7. Any idea why this
should be so? --- ANSWER: It is a secure square safe from attack by e4-e5. The
knight also avoids blocking the view of the bishop on g7 down the long
diagonal as it would do on f6. In games without a fianchetto the e7-square
will either be taken by the bishop, or putting the knight on that square would
box in the bishop on f8. Hence the ...Bg7 and ...Nge7 deployment go together
in this type of 'French structure' with ...e7-e6.} 7. c3 {You'll already be
aware of the importance of this move in White's deployment from Part One. He
blunts the power of the bishop on g7 and puts a support for a d3-d4 advance in
place. Not that he would necessarily play d3-d4 if allowed.} d5 {In Part One
Black mostly used the alternative pawn advance to e5 to claim an equal share
of space in the centre. Here 7...e5 is still possible, and you might like to
consult Game Three to see how to handle it. In this version White has an extra
tempo, because Black moves the e-pawn twice. Therefore it is more natural for
Black to lead with ...d7-d5 here.} ({After the alternative} 7... O-O {White
could gain space with} 8. d4 {,} ({but delaying the advance with the probing} 
8. Be3 $5 {is interesting. The game G.Kamsky-M.Bartel, Istanbul Olympiad 2012,
continued} b6 9. d4 cxd4 {. --- EXERCISE: Now the US Grandmaster played 10
Nxd4. Try to work out why he preferred this to 10 cxd4. It might help to
examine Black's pawn structure.} 10. -- ({. ANSWER: The positive points of} 10.
cxd4 {are that White would establish a full pawn centre, his queen's knight
would gain a post on c3, and he would maintain control over the e5-square. The
drawback is that Black could reply} d5 {, blocking the centre when after} 11.
e5 Nf5 {he has ideas of both 12...Nxe3, gaining the bishop-pair, and 12...f6
with counterplay against the white centre. It might also be useful to throw in
...Ba6 at some point.}) ({. Kamsky's choice} 10. Nxd4 {leads to a different
type of centre structure. It puts the spotlight on Black's pawn on d7. It is
reminiscent of a Sicilian Hedgehog set-up, but with Black's bishop committed
at an early stage to g7 rather than sitting on e7. It is well placed on g7 to
be sure, but it means that the d6-square is weaker than it would be in the
Hedgehog with the bishop on e7. Here, for example, Black can't play d7-d6 and
maintain the pawn on that square, as it would be besieged by moves like Nb5,
perhaps combined with a frontal assault by Qd2 and Rad1. If the pawn stays on
d7, the d6-square remains a hole in the black pawn structure: White could aim
to put a knight on that square, perhaps with a manoeuvre such as Na3, Nb5 and
Nd6. --- So the natural riposte by Black is to engineer the 'freeing' advance ...d7-d5. If he could carry this out safely he would be rid of his potentially
weak pawn on d7 and square on d6, and he would dissolve the white centre by
liquidating the e4-pawn. In that case Black would be perfectly fine - he could
soon get the advantage. --- Therefore Kamsky has to ensure that ...d7-d5 can't
be played by Black without incurring a structural disadvantage. The game

defence of d5 by pinning the knight)} dxe4 {. Rather than Kamsky's} 14. Bxe4 {
which lead to complications after 14...Qd7 offering the exchange,} ({I think} 
14. Rxe4 $1 {is stronger.} -- ({. For example, if now} 14... Qd7 {White can
keep up the pressure with} 15. Ndc2 $1 {(yes, this knight as White wants to
exchange queens; the threat is to take on d7 and then e7)} Rae8 16. Nb4 Bb7 17.

({. The tactical justification for 14 Rxe4 is that if} 14... Bb7 $2 {there
follows} 15. Rxe5 Bxg2 {(taking on e5 drops b7)} 16. Kxg2 Bxe5 {and now} 17.

no way that Kamsky was going to find this line during the game, unless he had
prepared it.} (18. --)))))) 8. Nbd2 Qc7 {As we shall see Black is planning to
castle queenside. He removes his queen from the back rank and puts her on her
useful square where she fights against the e4-e5 advance.} ({Instead,} 8... O-O
{is examined below in Game 12.}) 9. Re1 {The main strategic theme for White
here is engineer e4-e5 to gain space on the kingside. --- QUESTION: In Chapter
One, Black had his knight on f6 and bishop on e7 in this type of set-up,
whereas here he has the knight on e7, a pawn on g6 and bishop on g7. How does
that affect White's preparations for the e4-e5 advance? --- ANSWER: The
different layout of the black pieces on the kingside doesn't affect White's
basic aim, but it does complicate it somewhat. In Chapter One when he advanced
e4-e5 he gained time by attacking the knight on f6. With the knight safely on
e7 here, e4-e5 attacks nothing. Furthermore, if White plays e4-e5 too fast the
pawn will come under heavy attack from the bishop on g7 and his cronies, and
might even be lost. --- On the bonus side for White, in the present scenario
if he can establish and maintain the pawn on e5 then it will shut in the
bishop on g7 and give him the chance to try to exploit the holes in Black's
structure on f6 and h6 created by ...g7-g6. White had no such spur from a
loosened black pawn structure in Chapter One. --- I think Black's defence in
all the e4-e5 scenarios is difficult, but perhaps harder here than in Chapter
One.} b6 {The most active square for Black's light-squared bishop is b7. Black
avoids ...b7-b5 as he doesn't want to open up his king's future residence.} 10.
h4 {QUESTION: What are the good points of this move?} Bb7 ({ANSWER: White has
the following ideas in mind after 10 h4: 1) A plan of attack with h4-h5. This
would be particularly effective after} 10... O-O 11. h5 {, when the looming} --
12. hxg6 {already looks awkward for Black: the recapture} Nxg6 {leaves his
kingside pawns split up,} (12... fxg6 {weakens the centre}) ({and after} 12...
hxg6 {the king is vulnerable to attack on the h-file: White can play} 13. Ng5 {
, intending Qg4, Qh4 and Qh7 mate, when if Black drove away the knight with} f6
{he would weaken his centre squares. In reality White wouldn't necessarily
rush to play 12 hxg6 or 13 Ng5, the above moves are merely to demonstrate the
ideas available. --- 2) Clearance of the h2-square. This will allow the knight
to journey from d2 via f1 and h2 to g4, where it is in touch with Black's
sensitive dark square holes on f6 and h6. As with the h4-h5 attack, the knight
will be more menacing for Black if he has castled kingside. --- 3) Deterrence
of a black kingside expansion. This is all the more important as White plans
to advance e4-e5. The defence of the pawn would become problematical if Black
is allowed to play ...h7-h6 and ...g6-g5, when he has the options of ...Ng6 
(attacking the pawn directly) or ...g5-g4 (driving the knight away from f3).}))
({4) Waiting to see what Black does. If, for example, Black is tempted into} 
10... Ba6 {then} 11. exd5 {radically changes the nature of the centre. After}
exd5 ({if Black recaptures} 11... Nxd5 {then after} 12. Nc4 O-O-O ({if} 12...
O-O {we again have the idea of h4-h5}) 13. Qe2 {(only now), and White is ready
to attack with a4-a5 - a plan made stronger by the black bishop being on a6})
12. Nb3 {plans 13 Bf4, whereupon the pawn onslaught a4-a5, if Black castles
queenside, or h4-h5, if he castles kingside, will give White the initiative.})
({Black avoids provoking a crisis by aiming at d3 with} 10... Ba6 {- see the
note above. Navara therefore puts his queen on e2 to support the e4-e5 thrust.}
) 11. Qe2 {It's rather unusual for White to play both Re1 and Qe2 in this
system, but needs must: the white pawn on e5 will require three defenders.}
O-O-O ({White would have good attacking chances against the black king after} 
11... O-O {. He would probably begin with 12 e5, then the pawn stab h4-h5, and
finally the knight manoeuvre Nf1, Nh2, Ng4 eyeing the dark square holes on f6
and h6.}) 12. e5 {Finally the moment is ripe to seize the e5-square.} h6 {
Black is already thinking about 13...g5!? as a means to undermine the pawn on
e5. --- QUESTION: What is the best way for White to prevent this? --- ANSWER:}
13. Nf1 $1 {Now the bishop on c1 has an eye on the g5-square, but Black hasn't
given up on the pawn thrust yet.} Kb8 14. N1h2 d4 {As a prelude to his next
move, Black cuts off any support of e5 with d3-d4.} 15. c4 g5 {EXERCISE: How
should White respond to Black's pawn offer? --- ANSWER:} 16. h5 $1 ({If you
are a computer you probably grabbed the pawn with} 16. hxg5 {, whereupon play
might go} Ng6 17. Ng4 h5 18. Nh6 {(so that the h-file remains blocked even
after Black's next move)} h4 $5 19. Nxh4 Nxh4 20. gxh4 Bxe5 {. White is a pawn
up which makes the program Houdini happy, but are you? Black will have an
enormous amount of counterplay against the dislocated white kingside. ---
Navara prefers to keep control. The game move blocks the kingside, allowing
White to focus on his queenside build-up.}) 16... Nf5 17. a3 Bf8 {The bishop
rejoins the centre and will play a useful defensive role in helping to block
White's b2-b4 advance.} 18. Rb1 {At last White's attack on the queenside is
getting into gear.} Ng7 19. Nd2 {A little dance by the black and white knights
as the h5-pawn has to be protected.} Be7 20. Ndf1 a5 {Black reinforces his
control over the b4-square to hinder White's pawn break.} 21. Bd2 Rc8 22. b3
Rhd8 23. Rb2 Bf8 24. g4 Ne8 25. Ng3 Ka7 {EXERCISE: What do you think is
White's best plan? What move should he start with? --- ANSWER: White has two
pawn breaks. On the kingside he could play f2-f4 at a suitable moment. Then
after ...g5xf4 and the recapture Bxf4 he could target the h6-pawn with Qd2 or
else create a passed h-pawn with g4-g5, etc. This scheme would require careful
preparation, for example White might place his rooks on e1 and f1 if that can
be arranged without dropping the e5-pawn. Since the mass of black pieces are
on the queenside, a long way from the h6-pawn which is targeted, it is a
plausible plan. Naturally Black would have a lot of counter resources - he
still has every piece and pawn on the board - and opening up lines in front of
your king is not to be undertaken lightly. --- On the queenside White would
love to advance b3-b4, but Black has four units guarding the square: the
knight, bishop and pawns on a5 and c5. White needs a fifth unit to empower
b3-b4. It has to be the knight, but it is hard to see how White can manoeuvre
it to c2 to support the advance. If the rook leaves the e1-square to clear a
way via f3, e1 and c2, the e5-pawn drops. --- In the game Navara made a brave
and creative decision.} 26. Bxc6 $5 {This tips the balance of forces engaged
in the fight over the b4-square in White's favour. But the cost seems very
high: we have exchanged off the minor piece we are most loathe to part with in
the King's Indian Attack. And look, after Black's reply he is threatening mate
on g2.} Qxc6 27. f3 {White's bishop has gone, but he remains very solid on the
light squares. It will be a long time before Black can arrange an attack on
the white king, if it can be done at all. Meanwhile White's attack with b3-b4
is coming very fast - next move, in fact. The white rooks will then enjoy an
open file against the black king. To cap it all, the white knight is going to
be a great piece on e4. --- Nonetheless, it is difficult to make a move like
26 Bxc6, even if the blocked nature of the pawn structure favours knights
rather than bishops. It is important that Black has no counterplay whereas
White's attack is already in full swing.} Nc7 28. b4 Qa4 {EXERCISE: What is
the best plan for White now?} ({Seeing that he will be pulverised after} 28...
cxb4 29. axb4 Bxb4 30. Bxb4 axb4 31. Rxb4 {followed by 32 Reb1 and 33 Qb2,
Black tries to hold things together by defending a5 and attacking a3 with his
queen.}) 29. b5 $1 {ANSWER: Another important decision. Top players are very
flexible in their thinking and are ready to change track the instant that the
position requires it. White abandons his plan of attack on the queenside in
order to shut Black's queen out of the game. Even without calculation it is
obvious that after 29...Qxa3 the queen is going to be trapped sooner or later.
--- So now White has to switch to 'plan B' as discussed in the notes to 25...Ka7: a breakthrough with f3-f4. It will be all the stronger with the black
queen out of action. Notice the patience of the Czech Grandmaster: spurning
the chance for a quick knock-out blow on the queenside, he is willing to play
a long positional attack on the kingside.} Be7 30. Ne4 Rg8 {Black braces
himself for the f3-f4 advance, but in leaving d8 the rook allows a different
invasion.} 31. Nd6 $1 Bxd6 32. exd6 Na8 33. Ra1 {A clinical move. White wants
to invade with Qe5 without allowing ...Qxa3 in reply. --- QUESTION: What do
you think of the activity of the black pieces? --- ANSWER: The black queen has
no safe move. The same is true for his bishop and knight. I think that about
sums it up. More than half of Black's army is stalemated.} e5 {Black tries a
sacrifice or else Qe5, then f3-f4 will destroy him.} 34. Qxe5 Rge8 35. Qf5 Re6
36. Qxf7 Rxd6 37. f4 {At last it is time for the thematic breakthrough. If
Black plays 37...gxf4 White will create a passed pawn with g4-g5 at the right
moment.} Rc7 38. Qf8 Re6 39. fxg5 Re2 {EXERCISE: It looks as if Black has
suddenly gained counterplay. How would you kill it off? --- ANSWER:} 40. Qf1 $1
{Exactly. White gives up his queen for a rook and bishop knowing that his
kingside pawns are going to win the day.} Rg2+ 41. Qxg2 Bxg2 42. Kxg2 hxg5 43.

White's system of attack against the black kingside in the previous game, in
which Black had castled queenside. The build-up is even more potent with the
black king sitting on g8. --- One of the great things about the KIA is that

inferior as it lets White block things up. A better way for Black to gain
counterplay was 12...b5 13 Bf4 b4, but I still like White's attacking chances.
--- It won't always be this easy, but this game shows the clear logical
progression of White's general plan once he gets a grip on the e5-square. It's

{In this chapter we'll investigate the King's Indian against the Caro-Kann,
beginning with the moves} 1. e4 c6 2. d3 {. Though as we shall see, the
typical black centre structure with pawns on c6, d5, and e5 can arise via
other opening systems, including those after 1 Nf3. In a game given here,
Nakamura actually began with 1 g3. Therefore, even if you play 1 Nf3 or have a
different opening line prepared against the Caro-Kann, it would be a good idea
to study the games in this chapter.} -- ({Black's choice of pawn centres:
After 1 e4 c6 2 d3 Black virtually always puts a pawn on d5 or e5 at some
point - often he builds a full pawn centre with both these moves. Thus in Game
14 we see the sequence} 2... d5 3. Nd2 -- (3... e5 4. Ngf3 Bd6 5. g3 Nf6 ({in
Game 19 I've gathered together three rather sharp and offbeat approaches for
Black built around} 5... f5 $5 {. White has played slowly, blocking in both
the bishops on f1 and c1, and spending a tempo on the leisurely g2-g3.
Therefore Black feels justified in trying to overrun the centre with his pawns.
This is a tricky idea for White to meet. Still, it would be strange if he was
overwhelmed, as Black only has one piece developed himself}) 6. Bg2 O-O 7. O-O
Bg4 {. Black has borrowed an idea from the Slav ...Bg4 System of Chapter Six.
His position is a tough nut to crack. His king is safe, his development is
smooth, and his pawns have more than their fair share of the centre.
Nonetheless, White maintains some minuscule advantages. His bishop is more
comfortable on g2 than Black's bishop on g4, which might find itself shut out
of the action. White has the f4-square securely defended, whilst the f5-square
could be a base for his knight. Black's pawns do, indeed, have more than their
share of the centre, but the pawns on both d5 and e5 are potential targets.
It's easier for White to arrange an attack on them than it is for Black to
organise counterplay against the e4- or d3-pawns.}) ({. Alternatively Black
can combine building a big centre with the fianchetto of his bishop on g7 with
the moves} 3... g6 4. g3 Bg7 5. Bg2 e5 6. Ngf3 Ne7 7. O-O O-O {. Black suffers
somewhat from the fact that to keep e5 defended the knight has had to go to
the inferior e7-square rather than f6. As in Game 14 the black centre is a
target, and after} 8. Re1 d4 {White can besiege the d4 point with either} 9.
Nc4 {and 10 c3 (Game 15)} ({or the immediate} 9. c3 {(Game 16).})) ({. A third

Qxf3 e6 {. In this sequence Black put his bishop on g4 to avoid having it shut
in after ...e7-e6. Its subsequent exchange has given White the fabled
advantage of the two bishops, though he will have to work hard to make them
count for anything. Still, White can be pleased that he has the chance to
expand with moves like f2-f4 and e4-e5 in the future, a strategy that came out
tops in Game 17.}) ({. Two other lines examined in the notes to Game 19 are
the alternatives} 3... dxe4 {and 4...Nd7 in the above sequence. --- The
chapter ends with a splurge of analysis that must look rather unappealing to
someone who plays the KIA looking for a quiet life on the theoretical front.
Well, needs must and you'll find a critical line after 5...f5.})) ({
Alternatively, Black can choose a 'Philidor' centre with the moves ...e7-e5
and ...d7-d6: for example,} 2... e5 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nbd2 d6 5. g3 g6 6. Bg2 Bg7

Indian Defence (KID) versus the KIA: for example, see Game 41 in Chapter Eight.
Here Black is already committed to ...c7-c6, while in the KID version he might
prefer ...Nc6. White has a small edge as he is moving first in a symmetrical
position. It is OK for Black, but perhaps the Philidor pawn centre is a little
too passive for modern taste. Tiviakov outplays his opponent in exemplary
style in Game 18.}) *

What is the purpose of this move? --- ANSWER: Nakamura breaks the pin on f3,

which allows the knight on d2 more freedom of action, and, finally, Black is
forced to respond to a possible threat of 10 exd5 and 11 Nxe5.} Re8 ({Navara

more active move with his knight in mind.}) 10. Nh4 Na6 11. a3 {EXERCISE: Why
do you think White plays this feeble-looking pawn move? --- ANSWER: Nakamura
has to stop 11...Nb4 with the threat of 12...Nxc2, not only winning a pawn,
but also trapping the queen.} ({If instead he plays} 11. c3 {, he weakens his
defence of d3;} Nc5 {would then contain the awkward threat of 12...Nxd3.})

bishop. He intends to have one bishop aiming at the d5-pawn, the other at e5.}
dxe4 {If you ask David Navara why he played 12...dxe4, he would probably just
shrug and say that in his judgement it felt right to stabilize the centre so
that his pieces have more freedom of action. --- If we are looking for a
concrete reason, we might mention that White is planning Bb2 and then Nf5. The
bishop on d6 would like to retreat to f8 in response, but then the e5-pawn
could be a target after e4xd5. Note also that the Czech Grandmaster plans ...Ne6. This contains ideas of ...Nd4 and is also a deterrence against White
advancing f2-f4. The ...Ne6 move would, however, be problematical if White had
the option of e4xd5 in conjunction with the moves Nf5 and Bb2.} 13. dxe4 {
QUESTION: If it were White's turn to move now, can you suggest a good
positional idea for him? --- ANSWER: Nakamura would jump at the chance to play
14 Nc4, activating the knight with the positional threat of 15 Nxd6. Even if
the knight was kicked back from c4 by a subsequent ...b7-b5 after Black has
evaded the Nxd6 exchange, it could return to e3, a better square for the
knight than d2 as it is further up the board and in contact with the f5-square.

Bf8 {White can play sharply with} 16. f4 {. --- QUESTION: How to assess this
position? --- ANSWER: This pawn stab is a fundamental idea, suggested by both
the pawn structure and more specifically White's deployment of the bishop to
b2. On the other hand, it happens in the full fury of the black pieces. After}
exf4 17. gxf4 {the e4-pawn is attacked by both black knights and the rook on
e8. It is a fine pawn and mobile, but if it collapses it's all over for White.
After the cold-blooded} Rad8 {, adding more dynamism to the black pieces, the
exchange} 18. Bxf6 gxf6 {doesn't achieve anything for White. Then} 19. Ng3 Bg6
20. f5 {, trapping the bishop, fails to} Bd6 $1 21. fxg6 ({or} 21. Rf3 Bxg3 22.
Rxg3 Rxd2 $1 {, overloading the white queen who has to defend g3}) 21... Bxg3
22. gxh7+ Kh8 {. --- Nonetheless, the e4-pawn lives despite all the pressure.
White can continue after 17...Rad8 with 18 e5, for example. The position
remains double-edged, but you can understand why human players at least would
like to avoid this as Black. I think most (human) players would wilt in the
face of ideas such as Bxf6 or the apparent trapping of their bishop, or indeed
the advance 18 e5. A computer likes Black's activity, but then they aren't
programmed to feel fear. --- Navara's knight move is both active minded - it
aims for an invasion on d4 - and defensive minded - it prevents the f2-f4
advance.}) 15. Ndf3 {It is White's turn to spoil the dreams of a black knight
by preventing 15...Nd4. At the same time e5 is attacked.} Bxf3 {Black concedes
the bishop-pair, but on the other hand, he is well entrenched on the dark
squares.} 16. Nxf3 Qc7 {The idea of arranging f2-f4 is pretty much dead as
Black has four pieces trained on the f4 point and besides White's knight is
needed on f3 to watch over the d4-square. Nakamura therefore focuses on the
queenside and the open d-file. Once lines open up in the distant future
White's light-squared bishop might become a powerful piece.} 17. Qe2 a6 18.
Rfd1 c5 {Black gains space on the queenside. --- EXERCISE: The move 19...Nd4
is on the cards, when Black's knight finally gets to utilize the d4-square.
What is the best way to anticipate it? a) Prevention with 19 c3. --- b)
Preparation of c2-c3 with Rac1. --- c) The immediate attack on b5 with 19 a4.}
19. c3 {ANSWER: Nakamura chooses to keep the knight put of d4. At the same
time he vacates the c2-square as a stopping off post for his knight in a
manoeuvre to d5. Nevertheless, the drawback is obvious: the bishop on b2 is
shut in and the pawn on b3 is left loose. As we shall see below, these factors
could have been exploited by Black.} ({A better idea is} 19. Rac1 {which
deters Black from playing} Nd4 {as} 20. Nxd4 cxd4 ({after the alternative
recapture} 20... exd4 {,} 21. c3 $1 {is still strong - White's bishop on b2
will have an open diagonal aiming at f6, and White's f2-pawn can become mobile
with f2-f4 now that the barrier on e5 is removed}) 21. c3 $1 {opens up the
c-file and d-file to the joy of White's rooks and the distress of the black
queen and bishop. Therefore after 19 Rac1 Black should avoid 19...Nd4, after
which it's not that exciting for White.}) ({Finally, that brings us to} 19. a4
{. If then} b4 {the d4-square is secured for the knight, but the black
queenside pawns are mouldy, especially as he doesn't have a light-squared
bishop to defend the hole on c4. White could reply 20 Qc4 when the queen is
nicely placed - an attempt to evict her with 20...Nd7, intending 21...Nb6,
could be met with 21 a5!.} ({The key variation after 19 a4 is} 19... Nd4 20.

think Black should have tried} 20... h5 {to exploit the white knight's absence
from f3? --- ANSWER: With the text Black plays too passively in the face of
White's plan of Nc2, Ne3, and Nd5. It seems that Navara was so wrapped up in
his plan of controlling the dark squares that he missed some good light-square
moves. As the knight has left f3, 20...h5!? would threaten to undermine

knight.}) 24. c4 $1 Rab8 25. Rac1 {EXERCISE: In what ways has White improved
his position over the last few moves? --- ANSWER: Whilst Black has been
floundering with his pieces, Nakamura has made great strides forward. He has
brought his knight into contact with the key d5-square; his bishop on b2 has
been reactivated by c3-c4; and his rook on c1 is making life uncomfortable for
the pawn on c5 and the queen hiding behind it. It's no wonder that Black's

{Part Two - Black builds a big pawn centre with ...Bg7:} 1. e4 c6 2. d3 d5 3.
Nd2 g6 {Black finds a different way to support his pawn centre with the bishop.
} 4. g3 Bg7 5. Bg2 e5 6. Ngf3 Ne7 {QUESTION: Are there any drawbacks to
Black's opening system? --- ANSWER: You can't have everything you want in an
opening, especially if you are playing Black against an alert opponent. In a
perfect world Black would build a pawn centre with ...d7-d5 and ...e7-e5, get
to fianchetto his bishop with ...g7-g6 and ...Bg7, and play ...Nf6 and ...Nbd7.
However, one of these moves always proves impossible due to White's pressure
or lack of time. Here, for example, the black knight goes to e7, so that the
bishop on g7 keeps e5 defended, but this means that the 'ideal' move ...Nf6
won't be part of his deployment. --- We might also add that fianchetto on g7
has removed the bishop from contact with the queenside. Therefore an attack on
a black pawn on d4 with c2-c3, which results in the opening of the c-file, has
more power. This is especially seen in Game 16, below, in which White's
dark-squared bishop proves of far more worth than the bishop on g7 because it
has influence over the queenside struggle.} ({QUESTION: Couldn't Black try} 
6... Nd7 7. O-O Ngf6 {when he has his knight on the 'best' square f6? ---

intact, when} 10. Nxe5 Nxe5 11. Rxe5 Ne4 {traps the white rook?} ({. ANSWER:

{, as} 10. Ncxe5 $2 f6 {traps the knight. White could retreat the knight to a3

would give option 'b' preference. It takes advantage of the fact that pieces

d4, Movsesian begins to undermine it.} b5 {QUESTION: How should White continue
if Black plays 10...c5 standing his ground in the centre?} ({ANSWER: If Black

a breakout with ...a7-a5 in the event that White has played Nc5 or otherwise
weakened his grip on that square. Secondly, the bishop move improves the
overall coordination of the white pieces as it clears the way for the rook on

that 10 b4 is applauded as a space-gaining move on the queenside, whilst
Black's identical move 10...b5 is condemned as a needless weakening. You might
recall the old rule that you shouldn't move pawns on the side of the board
where you are weakest. Here White has the initiative on the queenside because
of his extra move, so Black shouldn't present him with a target on b5. White
should be made to work to open lines or create a weakness, he shouldn't be
presented with one for free. --- With 10...d5 Black follows a traditional
recipe: an attack on the wing is met with a counterattack in the centre.
Fortunately for White his centre is so heavily fortified in the King's Indian
Attack that Black can seldom strike a strong blow against it. On the other
hand, this strength comes from the white centre being held back in a compact
mass. In the early stages of the game at least White's pawns can't cause the
opponent much trouble in the centre. Therefore he has to try to gradually
outplay him with little moves on the wings.} ({ANSWER: It would be foolish for

the e5-pawn. So he plays:} b6 {But now the black queenside pawns are more
fragile; a fact not lost on Tiviakov who prepares to ram them with c3-c4.

would be rather shut in on b7.} 12. Qc2 Bb7 13. c4 dxe4 {Black activates his

position? --- ANSWER: At first glance it looks pretty equal. However, it is
easier for White to attack the c5-pawn than it is for Black to launch a
similar assault on c4. Besides White's pawn on c4 is already defended by the
queen, and he has what David Bronstein called the most powerful weapon in
chess - the next move.} 17. Nd2 Nd7 {You might have noticed that both players
have an idea outpost for a knight along the d-file. If White's head for the

ideal post first, but 20...Nd4, which also happens to hit the white queen,
leaves Black fully equal. --- EXERCISE: Tiviakov finds a much better plan. Can
you see it? --- ANSWER:} 18. Nb3 $1 {White's knight chooses the b3-square so
in combination with the bishop on e3 it can assail the c5-pawn. The black
knight's journey to Nirvana on d4 has to be delayed until the pawn is
sufficiently defended. Hence his next two moves.} Qc7 19. Be3 Bf8 {The c5-pawn
is OK for the moment, but how annoying for the knight that the f8-square is
now blocked by the bishop.} 20. Rab1 Bc6 21. Qc3 $1 {A little move, but very
poisonous. As we shall see, the white queen is preparing to invade on a5.} Rab8

b-file and so prepares to double rooks along the d-file. Black responds in
kind by switching his rook to d8.} 23. Rd2 Nb6 $5 {Fridman offers the c5-pawn
as he has calculated that he will obtain sufficient counterplay.} 24. Rxd8 Rxd8

moves from castling kingside. The knight still being on g8 is horrible for
Black with the centre opening. --- Secondly, the black queen is on an awkward
square where she can be pinned against her king. --- Thirdly, Black doesn't
have time to stabilize the centre with 11...Nf6 as the other knight drops to
12 Qa4+ and 13 Qxd4. --- Fourthly, White's rook can quickly get to e1 to
embarrass the black king and queen. Meanwhile both of Black's rooks are
passive. --- And, finally, and most important of all, Black is going to have
to lose further time or position in safeguarding the hanging knight on d4. If
White is allowed to capture it with 12 Qa4+ and 13 Qxd4 he will have an easily
winning position.} Bd7 {The game move prevents the check on a4. Other moves

{I probably shouldn't shout it too loudly, but objectively speaking the King's
Indian Reversed is the biggest enemy of the King's Indian Attack. Black gets
to seize more than his fair share of the centre while developing his pieces to
good squares and avoiding weaknesses. Against a strong player - Kramnik
springs to mind for some reason - White could easily end up worse due to his
space deficit. --- On the other hand, you aren't playing Kramnik (if you are
then thanks for buying my book and can I have your autograph?). If you like
the KIA set-up as White you won't worry about any 'objective' assessment that
claims you're '0.21' of a pawn down. You get the chance to play the sort of
chess you love, striking at the opponent's centre from a solid, albeit slight
cramped base. And being true to your style is what matters in chess. ---
There's another reason not to worry too much about the King's Indian Reversed:
it isn't a very popular choice for Black. Partly it's psychological. It is
hard for Black to overcome the reasoning 'The King's Indian Defence is a
dangerous opening to face as White. To play into the King's Indian main line
structure a tempo down as Black must be very risky'. In reality Black is in no
danger of being smashed by a sharp line in the King's Indian Reversed as long
as he plays steadily, not trying to refute the opponent's set-up, but
developing his pieces and consolidating his centre. --- Furthermore, a player
below elite level is unlikely to have the King's Indian Reversed in his
repertoire as it is a lot of effort to learn when the chances of getting it in
a tournament game are small. Even one move before it is reached after} 1. Nf3
d5 2. g3 c5 3. Bg2 Nc6 {, White can diverge with} 4. d4 {, making it a
Reversed Grünfeld. And in the Sicilian move order after 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 there
are a whole lot of other opening lines a player will want to spend his limited
time looking at.} ({Move order: The 'traditional' move order is} 4. d3 e5 5.
O-O Nf6 6. Nbd2 Be7 7. e4 {, but in practice this is not too common. The game
is more likely to begin 1 Nf3 c5 2 g3 Nc6 3 Bg2 e5 (to avoid the Reversed
Grünfeld after 3...d5 4 d4) 4 d3 d5 5 0-0 Nf6 6 Nbd2 Be7 7 e4 or via a
Sicilian with 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 d3 Nf6 4 g3 d5 5 Nbd2 e5 6 Bg2 Be7 7 0-0.

guarding important squares such as d5 and d4. Meanwhile Black has no pawns on
the d-file or e-file to fight for the centre. --- If this doesn't appeal you

({The important alternative} 7... O-O {is seen in the next game.}) 8. Nc4 {
ANSWER: The advance of Black's pawns has left some of his centre squares under
defended. Thus White has: 1) The c4-square for the queen's knight, from where
it attacks e5. --- 2) The f5-square for the other horse. Because Black has
played 6...Be7, he can't defend this square with ...g7-g6 without weakening
his kingside dark squares. --- 3) The e5-square as a hook on which he can
latch a clear and logical plan: the preparation of the advance f2-f4 to gain
space on the kingside. --- Sune Berg Hansen moved the knight from the passive
square d2 to activity on c4. Well, actually only part of that is true. His
horse was actually sitting on a3, as I took quite a liberty with the move
order in this game, which began 1 Nf3 c5 2 g3 Nf6 3 Bg2 Nc6 4 0-0 d5 5 d3 e5 6

it's a good idea for White to put the knight on f5, or is there a better means

wants pawns on those squares.}) 11... Nd7 12. Nf3 ({Again after} 12. Nf5 Bf8 {
there would be no convincing continuation for White. The 18th century French
Master Philidor said that the pieces are the servants of the pawns. In this
spirit the White's knight deferentially retreats now that it has cleared the
way for the f-pawn to advance.}) 12... Bf8 13. f5 {QUESTION: Why is this
preferable to 13 fxe5, which opens the f-file for a possible attack and might
allow the white bishop to cause discomfort to the queen with Bf4?} ({ANSWER:
Black has four units guarding the e5-square, and if necessary after} 13. fxe5
Ndxe5 {it could be bolstered further with ...f7-f6. Therefore, the possibility
of a Bf4 pin doesn't really alarm Black. --- Let's analyse:} 14. Ncxe5 Nxe5 15.
Nxe5 Qxe5 16. Qf3 Qe6 $1 ({natural is} 16... Be6 {, but then} 17. Bf4 {really

the exchanges have cleared the way for the bishop on c8 to enter into the game.
One of the good things about the KIA is that you get the chance to keep small
but permanent advantages. More direct openings often lead to a rapid burnout
of the kind in this note: White has an open file, sets one or two traps, Black
has to find a couple of precise but not too difficult moves, and a draw is
agreed. --- Instead, after 13 f5 White has no direct threats, but the f5-pawn
looms balefully over the black kingside. All the minor pieces remain on the
board, giving Black some problems to solve: how to develop his bishop on c8,
how to generate queenside counterplay and how to meet White's potential
kingside pressure. The more problems you set an opponent, the more likely he
is to go wrong.}) 13... b6 {Black shows his hand: he will slowly prepare the
advance ...b6-b5 as a prelude to ...c5-c4. He is copying the standard plan for
White versus the King's Indian Defence.} 14. g4 a6 15. g5 Rb8 16. b3 b5 {
EXERCISE: How should White respond to the threat? a) Retreat the knight to b2.
--- b) Retreat the knight to d2. --- c) Retreat the knight to a3. --- d)
Exchange with 17 axb5 and only then decide. --- ANSWER: First of all, we
should decide whether we should exchange pawns on b5. The capture 17 axb5 is
one of those 'automatic' moves that the hand is itching to play. It reduces
the pawn front on the side of the board where White is weaker, which is
typically a good thing, as it means there are fewer things to come under
attack. And here it leaves White in possession of the a-file after the
recapture 17...axb5. --- So why is 17 axb5 actually a bad move? After 17...axb5 White indeed has control of the a-file, but it would soon disappear after
Black plays ...Bb7 and ...Ra8. This would at best amount to a distraction from
White's plan of kingside action, at worst trouble for him if Black managed to
break through along the a-file. Therefore White should avoid 17 axb5?! and
immediately retreat the knight. But where? --- We can dismiss option 'c'. Upon
17 Na3? bxa4! 18 bxa4 Black not only has the open b-file, but even worse for
White after 18...Nb6! the defence of the a4-pawn is a serious liability. ---
Very sensible seems to be 17 Ncd2 as it keeps the knight in the centre and in
touch with the kingside. A quick attack involving moves like the pawn ram
g5-g6, Nh4, Ndf3, and Ng5 looks threatening. But while this is being arranged
Black has instant counterplay on the queenside with 17...Na5! intending 18...c4. As we know chess strategy involves preventive as well as aggressive play.
Sometimes safety can be thrown to the winds, with everything staked on an
all-out attack. But Hansen has seen a way of defeating Black's queenside
counterplay, so why take risks? With this in mind he played:} 17. Nb2 $1 Na5
18. Bd2 $1 {This is the idea. The threat is 19 axb5, uncovering an attack on
the black knight. It wouldn't have been possible if White had blocked the
d2-square with 17 Ncd2.} c4 {The only consistent move.} ({Instead,} 18... b4 $4
{would be an appalling positional blunder as Black would deny himself any
chance of a breakthrough on the queenside, leaving White will a free hand on
the kingside.}) 19. dxc4 bxc4 20. Bxa5 Qxa5 21. Nxc4 Qc5 {White has won a pawn,
but the black pieces will enjoy a lot of open lines on the queenside.} 22. Kh1
Nb6 {EXERCISE: How should White respond to the attack on his knight? --- a)
Exchange it with 23 Nxb6. --- b) Retreat it with 23 Nb2. --- c) Support it
with 23 Nfd2.} 23. Nb2 ({ANSWER: The exchange} 23. Nxb6 Rxb6 {helps Black
unclutter his pieces: for example, next move he can play 24...Rc6 to put
pressure on c2.}) ({However,} 23. Nfd2 $5 {was an interesting alternative, as
White not only bolsters his queenside, but also clears the way for a quick
attack on the kingside with moves like Rf3, Rh3, and Qh5. --- In the game
Hansen reroutes his knight to the blockade square on d3 - also a fine plan.})
23... a5 24. Nd3 Qc7 25. g6 $1 {EXERCISE: Was the alternative pawn thrust 25
f6 just as good? And thinking generally, why do you think White chooses to
play for an attack on the kingside when he has an extra pawn which he could
try to exploit on the queenside?} ({ANSWER: After} 25. f6 g6 {it's hard to see
how White could carry an attack on the kingside: it's too blocked up. ---
White has an extra pawn on the queenside. The usual technique in such
situations is to create a passed pawn and force Black to give up material to
prevent it from queening. But looking more closely, we see that the advantage
the extra pawn confers in this particular instance is that it is part of an
impenetrable light-square wall that stretches from the pawn on a4 to the pawn
on e4, with the knight on d3 part of this unbreakable barrier.}) ({QUESTION:
Why is being super solid good for White? --- ANSWER: Because it deprives Black
of any activity on the side of the board where, strategically speaking, he
should be attacking due to the space advantage conferred by the pawn on d4.
--- Thus the c2 point would be easy to defend with Rf2 if ever assaulted. This
means that the black rooks and queen have nothing to attack. The bishop on f8
is also powerless, and the light-squared bishop can only attack e4 (easily
defended), or be exchanged with ...Ba6 and ...Bxd3, which would be a
strategically poor decision as Black is already weak on the light squares. ---
Whereas Black is stymied, White is free to push forwards on the side of the
board where he is meant to be attacking. He has no distractions to worry about
on the queenside or in the centre, so he can focus all his pieces on a
kingside attack. --- Let's imagine for a moment that White decided the right
plan was to create a passed pawn with a well prepared c2-c3 pawn advance,
followed by b3-b4 in due course. It's easy to see how this unravelling of the
queenside fortress would play into Black's hands. Once c2-c3 had been played,
the black rooks and queen would come alive along the b-file and the c-file,
and the black bishops would be able to snipe at the advancing pawns. It's far
better for White that everything stays quiet on the queenside. You'll see how
easily Black is overwhelmed by White's pieces once they get to grips with the
open lines presented by the pawn sacrifice} 25. g6 {. The pawn cannot be
tolerated on this square, and if} f6 26. gxh7+ Kxh7 27. Nh4 {then 28 Ng6 with
ideas like 29 Qh5+ looks horrible for Black.}) 25... hxg6 26. fxg6 fxg6 {
QUESTION: What has White gained through sacrificing a pawn on g6? --- ANSWER:
We can list the benefits of the sacrifice to the white pieces: 1) The rooks
get the open f-file and in some cases the g-file too. --- 2) The knight gets
to assail g6 (see the next move). --- 3) The queen is able to journey to g3 to
increase the pressure on g6. --- 4) The bishop acquires an open diagonal

What is the purpose of this move? --- ANSWER: If you have read the
introduction to the chapter you'll be aware that I don't like 8 c3 as it feels
like an unnecessary weakening of the centre. With the game move White is
waiting for Black to clarify the centre pawn structure with either ...d5-d4 or
...dxe4 (when White recaptures d3xe4). In either case it likely to be useful
to be able to play Nc4 without the knight being in danger of being pushed back
by ...b7-b5.} ({Another way of waiting is with} 8. h3 {when after} Re8 9. Nh2 {

have a regrouping with ...Nc7 available to him as his queen blocks the square.

further at bay is welcome. --- Playing h2-h3 rules out ...Bg4, which can be an

made by someone rated 2324 Elo who must have played a lot of good moves in his
life. The idea is that 12 c3? allows 12...Nd3 when no one will be laughing at
the knight anymore. Meanwhile White is prevented from playing 12 Qe2 as a
prelude to Nc4, as 12...Nxc2 wins a pawn. There is another clever point to the
knight foray revealed in the note to the next move. --- Nonetheless, the
knight move fails because White doesn't have to hurry. Black has no strong
follow-up, and sooner or later the knight will have to return to defensive
duties on c6. We can therefore add this game to the other examples of Black
losing his patience against the KIA and starting an aggressive action that
isn't justified by the position.} ({Black might have preferred} 11... h6 {

pawn structure favour White? --- ANSWER: The pawn structure in the centre is
almost symmetrical, but not quite. Black has a pawn on c5 and White a pawn on
c3. This means that the white knight has a potential outpost square on d5 as
it can't be kicked away by a pawn, whereas the black knight is denied entry to

{Black might decide to counter 1 Nf3 by building a 'Slav' triangle of pawns on
c6, d5, and e6. This is a very solid centre structure, but it has the drawback
that the bishop on c8 finds all roads to activity blocked. Therefore it makes
sense to get the bishop out before playing ...e7-e6. This can be done with a
quick ...Bg4, which is the subject of Chapter Six, or ...Bf5 which we'll
discuss here. --- A typical opening sequence is:} 1. Nf3 d5 2. -- (2. g3 Nf6 3.
Bg2 c6 4. O-O Bf5 {To keep play in the style of the King's Indian Attack,
White will engineer an e2-e4 pawn advance beginning with d2-d3 and Nbd2; if he
prefers the c2-c4 pawn advance we are in the territory of the Réti Opening.
--- From the position above play might continue} 5. d3 e6 6. Nbd2 Be7 7. b3 O-O
8. Bb2 h6 9. Qe1 a5 10. e4 Bh7 {White has developed his queen's bishop to an
open diagonal on b2 and with the help of his queen achieved his aim of
advancing e2-e4. For his part, Black has secured a safe spot for his bishop on
h7 and has kicked off his queenside activity with 9...a5. The middlegame is
about to begin, with both players manoeuvring for advantage. This is the way
Game 23 below started.}) ({What are the advantages to Black's set-up?} 2. -- {
As we can see in the sequence above, Black gets to develop his pieces quickly
to good centre squares without being saddled with weaknesses in his pawn
structure. He can also be fairly sure that his king won't come under a big
attack in the early stages of the game. Indeed, White has to devote his energy
to arranging e2-e4, not to looking for the initiative. On the kingside Black
normally remains passive behind his solid defensive perimeter. More positively,
he can seek counterplay by utilizing his queenside pawns. A good way to start
is with 9...a5, as in the diagram above. Alternatively, Black might play in
the centre with ...d5xe4 and, after White's recapture d3xe4, try to exploit
the open d-file and put pressure on the e4-pawn. However, this idea is mostly
specific to a situation where White plays a quick Ne5, as in Game 24.}) ({What
are the disadvantages to Black's set-up?} 2. -- {Black hardly ever manages to
equalize the space balance on the kingside with ...e6-e5. Therefore White can
hope in the future to engineer an f2-f4 advance, followed in some cases by
f4-f5. This would besiege the e6-pawn and lead to the opening of the f-file as
the preliminary to an attack on the black king. Sometimes the alternative
advance e4-e5 can be strong, but this is somewhat problematical as it shuts in
a bishop posted on b2 and gives the enemy bishop on h7 more daylight. We might
say that the e4-e5 advance is either very strong or very weak. --- An
important part of White's strategy depends on patience. He has to manoeuvre
his pieces and keep them in good shape whilst waiting for the chances that
appear when Black, in search of the initiative, loosens his position. In this
respect the King's Indian Attack is like a martial art: White often tries to
use the opponent's strength or momentum against him. Thus he will let Black
advance on the queenside in the hope that he will over extend himself, so that
his advancing pawns run out of energy and become hard to defend. ---
Opportunities for White might also arise in the centre as Black's plan unfolds.
For example, the pawn on d5 looks like an immovable barrier to the bishop on
g2 as it is guarded by henchmen on c6 and e6. But in the natural course of
Black's queenside action he could well play ...c6-c5 to utilize the pawn as a
battering ram (he may also want to free the c6-square for his knight). In that
case the d5-pawn suddenly becomes a legitimate target. --- Or imagine if Black
exchanges with ...d5xe4 in order to be the first to get his rooks to the open
d-file. If White has coordinated his pieces well he can gradually wrest
control of it - Black's own plan is used against him.}) ({What sequence of
moves should I choose as White?} 2. -- {The order of moves isn't so critical
when the two armies don't begin their hand to hand fighting until the early
middlegame. You could even begin with 1 b3 and eventually reach a standard KIA
versus Slav position if that's what Black wishes. Of course, he could well
answer 1 b3 with 1...e5 or 1...c5 or some other set-up. The move 1 g3
encounters the same repertoire problem: we are fine against 1...d5 or 1...c5,
but what to do if 1...e5, stopping the KIA? There are many decent ideas, of
course, not least 2 c4 transposing to the English Opening, but it takes us out
of the scope of this book. --- The good thing about beginning 1 Nf3 is that it
cuts down Black's options - you've stopped 1...e5 and if 1...c5 you could play
2 e4 and then transpose to a KIA versus the Sicilian with 3 d3, etc.
Alternatively, you could answer 1...c5 with 2 g3 and 3 Bg2, and leave it to
Black to play a Reversed King's Indian or some other structure. In any case
you're keeping play within the bounds of the repertoire in this book. --- So
that's why 1 Nf3 is the move of choice in this part of the book, rather than 1
b3 or 1 g3. Having said all this, the first game I wish to show you in this
chapter does feature an early b2-b3 by White. It's too good to miss out on.}) (
{Do you love your knight more than your bishop?} 2. -- {Still thinking of move
order, a key question for White in the KIA with ...Bf5 is: 'How quickly do I
wish to commit myself to b2-b3 and Bb2, if at all?'. It's worth remembering
that as soon as you play b2-b3, you're closing down your options somewhat. ---
The alternative is to do something fast with the knight on f3. In Game 24 the
horse jumps forwards to e5 to clear the way for f2-f4, in Game 25 it goes to
h4 to harass the black bishop on f5, and in Game 26 it powers backwards with
Nfd2 to support the advance e2-e4. I'll leave it up to you to decide how you
wish to play after 'seeing the evidence' in this chapter.}) ({A model game:
Overcoming a problem in your opening repertoire can have a massive effect on
your results, and not just because you do better in the line that you have
improved. It lifts your overall mood and makes you play better in general when
you're not haunted by the fear 'What if my opponent plays the problem line
against me?'. It's even better when the variation you always lose against
becomes the line you always win against. --- I'd like to show you how a simple
change in my opening repertoire boosted my results and helped me get the IM
title. Up until 1985 with White I always used to enter into the New York
System versus the Réti with moves such as} 2. c4 c6 3. b3 Bf5 4. g3 Nf6 5. Bg2
h6 6. Bb2 e6 7. O-O Be7 8. d3 Bh7 9. Nbd2 Nbd7 10. a3 a5 {. I wouldn't have
the faintest idea what to do. My musings (or rather 'thoughts leading to
mental paralysis') were something like: 'If White advances in the centre then
the bishop on h7 comes to life. But if I do nothing Black can gain ground on
the queenside by preparing ...b7-b5, or in some cases by arranging an advance
in the centre himself with ...e5-e4. I already stand badly.' Whether this
assessment of the position was objectively true or not is irrelevant - what
mattered is that as a young player inexperienced in solving strategic problems
I was completely at sea, and suffered some horrible loses as White. --- I was
perplexed for a long time, but then I came across the game
Nimzowitsch-Rubinstein in Ray Keene's book Nimzowitsch-Larsen Attack. Yes,
here at last was the solution. If White didn't play 2 c4, the bishop on h7
could be shut out of the game because the d3-pawn would act like solid granite
(I got that expression from Nimzowitsch via Keene as well). That means the
e-pawn can advance without loosening the centre too much. --- It didn't take
much to tweak my opening repertoire, and I won my next six games against
Black's set-up. I went from holding my breath out of fear that my opponent
would play this set-up to holding my breath out of fear that he wouldn't 'fall
into the trap'. It makes you wonder how many players continue to persevere
with an opening that they always fail against, putting it down to bad luck
when their opponent plays the line they fear, rather than making the mental
effort to learn an opening that they actually understand.}) *

1. Nf3 d5 2. b3 Bf5 {QUESTION: Why does Rubinstein prefer to develop his
bishop straightaway rather than play 2...Nf6, which looks more natural?} ({
ANSWER: If Black had played} 2... Nf6 {, then he would have to renounce
developing his bishop to f5 with} 3. Bb2 e6 {,} ({or acquiesce to having his
pawns doubled after} 3... Bf5 4. Bxf6 exf6 ({or} 4... gxf6 {. Either recapture
looks OK for Black, who has the two bishops to offset his slightly compromised
pawns. Nonetheless, the classically-minded Rubinstein doesn't want to give his
opponent that option.}))) 3. Bb2 e6 4. g3 h6 {EXERCISE: We're told to avoid
pawn moves that don't have a clear purpose, especially of the h2-h3 or ...h7-h6 variety when they gratuitously weaken the kingside. Why then does Black,
a genius of positional play, spend a tempo pushing his h-pawn instead of
developing his queenside? --- ANSWER: The purpose of 4...h6 is to tuck away
the bishop on h7 in the event that White tries to hunt it down with Nh4 or
attacks it by arranging an e2-e4 pawn advance. In the latter event the cleric
would continue to exert pressure against e4 and, should White advance e4-e5,
further down the diagonal against d3 and c2. It's rather strange to see this
prophylactic move played before 4...Nf6, but it has also been used by modern
grandmasters.} 5. Bg2 Nd7 {We can object to this move, however. There might be
instances where c6 is a better square for the knight. Since Black is
definitely going to move his other knight to f6, why not 5...Nf6 straightaway?
If you have two options and you can't decide what to play, it's best to play
the move you are going to make sooner or later.} 6. O-O Ngf6 7. d3 Be7 8. e3 {
QUESTION: what is the purpose of this move? Why doesn't White get on with the
plan of advancing the pawn to e4 with Nbd2 and Re1, instead of messing about
with silly little half moves? --- ANSWER: White is making a cubby-hole for his
queen on e2 where she can support the key advance of the pawn to e4. This is
of course a vital strategic idea in the King's Indian Attack. However, modern
taste would be for 8 Nbd2, 9 Qe1, and 10 e4, which is somewhat more flexible.
In this alternative sequence the white queen may choose to stay on e1 for a
long time, so that Nbd2, Qe1, and e2-e4 is in effect saving a tempo over e2-e3,
Qe2, Nbd2, and e3-e4. --- However, note that in either case the queen is
utilized to force the pawn advance to e4. The rook is kept on f1 where it will
be better placed to support a future kingside action beginning with f2-f4,
once the knight on f3 is out of the way of course.} O-O 9. Qe2 c6 10. Kh1 a5 {
EXERCISE: It's your choice. Black is looking to gain space on the queenside.
Should White: a) Block the pawn with 11 a4. --- b) Play 11 a3 to meet 11...a4
with 12 b4. --- c) Ignore Black's plan with 11 Nbd2 as the a-pawn is no
threat? --- ANSWER:} 11. a4 $1 {EXERCISE: What is the best plan for Black? a)
Gain space in the centre with 11...Qc7 12 Nbd2 e5. --- b) Put the knight on c5
to deter e3-e4 by guarding the e4-square a fourth time. --- c) Seek
counterplay on the queenside with ...b7-b5.} ({It's very important for White
to do something about the black a-pawn. After the routine} 11. Nbd2 $2 {Black
can advance} a4 {with the initiative on the queenside. He wouldn't have to do
anything at once with the pawn, he could just leave ideas of ...a4-a3 or ...a4xb3 hanging over White's head. This would be a permanent distraction for
White from his plan of advancing on the kingside: for example, if he played
Rae1 at any point then ...a4xb3 would clear the way for an invasion of the
seventh rank by the black rook with ...Ra2. --- You can't play the King's
Indian Attack to a high level unless you play preventive, or prophylactic,
moves like 11 a4.}) ({However, option 'b', moving the a-pawn one square, is
also worthy of attention. If Black's knight were still on b8, rather than
developed to d7,} 11. a3 {might be preferable to 11 a4 as it would stop the
knight being developed to a strong post on the queenside with ...Na6 and ...Nb4. Incidentally, this justifies our doubt about the move 5...Nd7 - the
knight didn't need to be developed straightaway and might have done better
lingering for a while on b8. Modern players tend to keep the knight at home
until the situation has been resolved on the queenside, playing ...a7-a5
before developing the horse. It might well choose a6 over d7.} -- ({. After 11
a3, Black could press on with} 11... a4 {when} 12. b4 {(it's essential not to
let the queenside pawns be broken up by 12...axb3)} c5 $5 {is double-edged,
but White has kept his centre compact after} 13. bxc5 Bxc5 14. Nbd2 {.} (14. --
)) ({. Alternatively,} 11... c5 $5 {at once introduces the positional threat
of 12...a4 as White is denied 13 b4 in reply. So play could go} 12. a4 $1 {
when it takes two moves for the pawn to get to a4, but White can claim that 11.
..c5 has slightly loosened the black pawn structure. --- Since 11 a4 succeeds
in keeping things quiet on the queenside, and White is planning a kingside
initiative, it is the best move. There will be further discussion of the
merits of a2-a4 versus a2-a3 in the notes to Game 23.})) 11... Nc5 ({ANSWER:
First of all,} 11... b5 $2 {is the sort of blunder that Bill Hartston in his
book How to Cheat at Chess would say is perpetuated by players whose eyes are
too close together. After the reply} 12. Nd4 $1 {Black has no good response to
the double threat of 13 Nxc6, destroying his queenside pawns, and 13 Nxf5,
smashing up his central pawn structure and acquiring the bishop-pair. If Black
wants to venture ...b7-b5 he should at least prepare it with ...Bh7 to avoid
the knight fork. But it still wouldn't be a very good idea - the pawn advance
weakens the black queenside pawns more than it inflicts damage on White's
queenside pawns. This doesn't mean that ...b7-b5 is never a good plan; it can
be a telling blow if Black's pieces are well positioned to support it (for
example, a knight on b4 would be nice).}) ({The best idea for Black is to
arrange ...e6-e5. It might be worth preparing it with the 'comfort' move} 11...
Bh7 {, getting his bishop out of the range of attack by e3-e4 or Nd4, then ...Re8 and ...Bd6}) ({but there seems nothing wrong with the direct} 11... Qc7 $1
{as in option 'a' above: for example,} 12. Nbd2 e5 {. At first it seems like}
13. e4 {is a strong riposte, as after} dxe4 ({it turns out that instead of 13..
.dxe4 he can play} 13... Bh7 $1 {as} 14. exd5 cxd5 15. Nxe5 Nxe5 16. Qxe5 Qxc2
{works out well for Black}) 14. dxe4 Bh7 {White gains the option of Nc4 at a
good moment (not immediately as e4 falls, but following} 15. Nh4 {for example).
Black doesn't want to concede a good central post to the white knight. --- So
White should forgo trying to win a pawn with 14 exd5 and make do with 14 Nh4,
but Black is very solid. If White had adopted the 'modern' approach with Qe1
and e2-e4 - see the note to 8 e3 above - it would have been harder for Black
to arrange ...e6-e5 as White has an 'extra' move in the battle along the
e-file. --- The actual game move, 11...Nc5, stops the advance e3-e4 by
guarding the square a fourth time, but as it can't be prevented in the long
term the whole idea is faulty. The more effort a player makes to prevent a
move, the stronger that move becomes if the opponent succeeds in playing it.
The threat is often stronger than the execution. Rather than have your pieces
engage in a fool's errand, get them doing other useful stuff. Then when the
breakthrough you fear occurs, there may be so much going on that it will only
be one strategic feature among many on the board, rather than the key
strategic feature.}) 12. Nd4 {White clears the way for his f-pawn with gain of

Black play 2...c6 or 3...c6 before developing his bishop?} ({ANSWER: We know
we are playing the King's Indian Attack, but Black can't be too sure. If, for

English. Then White is not only attacking d5, but also clearing the way for a
quick Qb3 to exploit the bishop's absence from c8 to attack the b7-pawn.
Therefore Black normally plays 3...c6 (or earlier 2...c6) to strengthen the
d5-pawn before committing his bishop to f5. If White then switches to an
English set-up with c2-c4 and Qb3, he can always defend b7 with a move like ...Qb6 or ...Qc7. Besides, after ...c7-c6 Black can also consider answering c2-c4

hitting the black bishop. As was discussed in the earlier game, the Qe1, e2-e4,
and Qe2 approach which we see here is more flexible, as White sometimes delays
Qe2, or might avoid it altogether if something better turns up.} a5 {A bid for
counterplay that is also familiar from the previous game.} 10. e4 Bh7 {
EXERCISE: Can you give reasons why 11 e5 would be a bad move here? And also,
do you think White should meet the advance of the black queenside pawn with 11
a4, blocking it, or with 11 a3 to meet 11...a4 with 12 b4, 'slipping around'
it?} 11. a3 ({ANSWER: We have to reject} 11. e5 {as premature at best - or
perhaps I should be less kind and call it a serious mistake: 1) It shuts in
White's bishop on b2. --- 2) It takes the e5-square away from the knight (Ne5
is often a useful preliminary to gaining space with f2-f4). --- 3) It takes
away flexibility from the white centre, as the e4-pawn no longer supports a
future f4-f5 advance. --- 4) It makes Black's bishop on h7 a better piece
because it can now see the d3-pawn, which it can help to target in combination
with a future ...Nb4 deployment and a possible ...c5-c4 pawn advance (see 6...Nbd7 in the 5 b3 variation). --- In the previous game he chose a2-a4, but in
that scenario the black knight was already developed to d7. Here it is still
on b8, so after 11 a4 Black has available the strong manoeuvre 11...Na6 and 12.
..Nb4 when the black knight is on the equivalent of an outpost square deep in
White's territory: ejecting it with c2-c3 would weaken the white queenside and
centre too much. With a gigantic horse on b4 and a rock solid ...c6, ...d5,
and ...e6 structure, Black would have little to fear. Therefore Malakhov
prefers to cover the b4-square against a knight invasion with 11 a3, and
answer 11...a4 with 12 b4, keeping the white queenside pawns intact.}) 11... c5
{With 11...c5 Black has cleared the c6-square for his knight and so threatens
the ramming move 12...a4 again, as the response 13 b4 would now simply lose a
pawn to 13...cxb4. --- EXERCISE: How should White prevent Black's plan?} ({As
11 a3 has denied the black knight the b4-square, a popular alternative plan is
to put the horse on c5. After} 11... Na6 12. Qe2 Nc5 {White has two
continuations that gain a promising game with pressure in the centre:} 13. -- (
{. Firstly,} 13. Ne5 {utilizing the e5-square for the knight. Play might
continue} Qb6 14. Kh1 Rfe8 ({after} 14... Na4 {White has the riposte} 15. Ndc4
$1 dxc4 16. Nxc4 {and then 17 bxa4, winning a pawn}) 15. f4 {as in S.Maksimovic-M.Efroimski, Plovdiv 2008. Note that White has no reason to move
the rook from f1.}) ({. Secondly,} 13. e5 {, gaining space and intending to
station the knight on d4 rather than e5:} Nfd7 14. Nd4 Qb6 15. a4 {(avoiding
any funny stuff with 15...Na4)} Na6 16. Bh3 Nc7 17. Kh1 Qa6 18. f4 {as in L.Polugaevsky-K.Langeweg, Amsterdam 1972. As after 13 Ne5, White has no need or
intention of playing Rfe1: his rook will either stay on f1 to support an
advance on the f-file, or be used on the queenside if the action hots up there.
--- QUESTION: Hold on! You just gave a list of reasons why the e4-e5 advance
was bad for White in the note to 11 a3, so why is 13 e5 suddenly a good idea
here? --- ANSWER: Well, any move can be good or bad according to the idea or
thinking behind it. For example, the pawn move ...h7-h6 can be a stupid waste
of time when played by a beginner, but I gave 8...h6 an exclamation mark in
this game as it's an important part of Black's opening scheme. --- It is vital
that you look at the specific position in front of you - the interaction of
the pieces and pawns - before committing yourself to e4-e5. It should never be
done thoughtlessly, as it permanently changes the nature of the pawn structure.
A good question to ask yourself is: 'Does it take the energy away from my
pieces and give it to the opponent's pieces?' --- Polugaevsky sees that he
will have the advance f4-f5 at his disposal, which he can support with a
bishop on h3, rook on f1, and knight on d4. He hasn't given up on the light
squares or turned his centre into an inert mass - it is still alive, with the
potential to expand further.})) 12. a4 $1 {ANSWER: Of course. I hope after the
discussion above that this paradoxical double move of the a-pawn is your
instinctive reaction to the 11...c5 move. White has in no sense lost a tempo
by playing 11 a3 and then 12 a4. If he had played 11 a4 at once, Black
wouldn't have replied 11...c5 - he would probably have carried out the plan
outlined above of 11...Na6 and 12...Nb4. So by playing the pawn to a4 in two
goes White has dissuaded Black from carrying out the knight manoeuvre. ---
Pawns can't move backwards, so whereas White can 'change his mind' with 12 a4
Black can't change his mind by putting the pawn back on c6. The consequence is
that Black's grip on the d5-pawn is lessened and he remains with a hole on the
b5-square.} Nc6 13. Qe2 Re8 14. Rfe1 {QUESTION: I don't get it. White plays 9
Qe1, then 10 e4, then three moves later 13 Qe2 - that's fair enough, as he
wants to keep the rook on f1 to support an f2-f4 advance. But now he puts the
rook on e1 after all. --- Why not play 9 Re1, 10 e4, and then put the queen
directly on e2, saving a tempo by omitting the Qe1 move? Black has no way to
stop this, right? --- ANSWER: It's true that the game sequence represents a
loss of a tempo for White, assuming that play goes exactly the same after 9
Re1 as it does after 9 Qe1. However 'behind the scenes' Malakhov was making
sure he kept his rook on f1 in case Black adopted the plan of ...Na6 and ...Nc5 outlined in the note to 11...c5 above. The move Rfe1 wouldn't have
achieved anything in that scenario - on the contrary, it would be better left
on f1 to support f2-f4. --- Potkin chose a different approach, so it looks -
wrongly - like Malakhov has just squandered a tempo in not committing his rook
to e1 at an early stage.} ({Now circumstances are changed and White decides to
play in the centre as clearing the way for an attack with f2-f4 with} 14. Nh4
$6 {leaves Black nicely centralized after} Nd4 {.}) 14... Rc8 15. Ne5 Nd4 16.
Qd1 {Retreating pieces is an indignity you have to get used to in the King's
Indian Attack. The important thing is your strategic prospects - and here
White can be pleased that Black has no ...c5-c4 breakthrough, whilst he
himself can hope to expand on the kingside in the future.} Qc7 17. f4 Bf8 18.
Rc1 {Another quiet back rank move. The rook defends the c2-square a second
time to free his queen for active pursuits. --- EXERCISE: Imagine if Black now
plays 18...dxe4. How should White respond: 19 dxe4, 19 Nxe4, or 19 c3?} ({
ANSWER: After} 18. Rc1 dxe4 19. -- (19. dxe4 $2 Red8 $1 {is highly awkward for
the white queen. She has no safe moves and is pinned against her knight. This
shows that you can't always judge a move on general principles. At first
glance it looks right to maintain a pawn on e4, keeping the bishop on h7 shut
out of the game, and denying the black knights access to the d5- and
f5-squares. However, the embarrassment caused to the white queen along the
d-file is of much greater significance. --- A general principle does govern
the position after all, but it says: 'Don't open a file if your opponent can
exploit it.' As always in chess strategy, it is finding the general principle
that is 'top dog' in a specific situation that is the difficulty.}) ({. The
reply} 19. c3 {would be something of a concession by White, as he weakens what
is otherwise a very solid pawn chance and shuts in his bishop on b2 for at
least the time being. However, it can be argued that Black's 18...dxe4 has
caused even more damage to Black's structure and that 19 c3, driving back the
knight, is the way to exploit it. Possible lines after 18...dxe4 19 c3 are} Nc6

centre with 21 dxe4)} 21. Rxe3 bxc6 22. c4 {. In these scenarios White's
centre has been loosened, but his bishop on g2 has gained scope and Black's
pawn structure looks even more mouldy than White's. So we have to regard 19 c3

any initiative on the queenside. On the contrary, there is a hint of
light-square fragility on b5 and c4. He therefore has no good plan, and would
have to wait to see what White comes up with - this might be a gradual advance
of the white kingside pawns after a lot of preparation, of course.})) 18...

EXERCISE: Can you see any drawbacks to White's 9 Ne5 move? Also, what is the
plan behind 10...Na6, and what measures should White take in order to counter
it? --- Before discussing the questions above, let's see how play unfolds over
the next four moves:} 11. Kh1 dxe4 12. dxe4 Nc5 13. Qe2 Qd4 $1 14. Re1 Rad8 {
ANSWER: Black avoided ...Nbd7 in response to 9 Ne5, as it is a little passive.
Besides exchanging off the knight on e5 doesn't necessarily favour Black - it
is after all blocking the advance of White's e4-pawn. Instead Lopez Martinez
has a more ambitious plan: to put strong pressure on the e4-pawn in order to
paralyze White's build-up. With this in mind, he puts his queen on d4 and
queen's knight on c5, so that, including the other knight on f6 and bishop on
h7, he now has four units attacking the key e4 point. --- As well as this, the
queen on d4 and the rook on d8 exert pressure down the d-file. White can't
move the knight from d2 without e4 dropping, which means that for the moment
he can't develop his bishop from c1 nor his rook from a1. Thus we see a
drawback to 9 Ne5: if White had played 7 b3 and 8 Bb2 he would have developed
his queenside, and we couldn't call the d4-square weak if White's knight had
remained on f3 guarding it. --- Over the last few moves White has anticipated
Black's plan. He has made sure he can defend the pawn on e4 with both queen
and rook (Qe2, Re1), and evacuated his king from g1 before Black's queen
landed on d4 (Kh1). --- EXERCISE: White now needs to find a way to drive back
the black queen to ease the pressure on e4. Any suggestions? --- ANSWER:} 15.

EXERCISE: Imagine that Black decides his pieces are on their optimum squares
and so waits, say, with} 15... a6 {, and then plays passive moves like ...Rfe8,
...Bf8, and then in the absence of direct threats by White keeps moving the
bishop backwards and forwards with ...Be7 and ...Bf8, etc. How would you
slowly build up White's game? --- ANSWER: It's often the case that when a
player has adopted a strategy that doesn't involve the use of pawns things
come to a standstill, because all his big pieces are on good squares, but
there is no way to breakthrough to hurt the opponent. In this specific case
Black needs some cannon fodder to rush at the enemy and open lines, but all
the black pieces involved in the attack on e4 and along the d-file are too
expensive to sacrifice. --- In contrast, White's position still has scope for
improvement. His pawns on the queenside can add strength to his game, and we
shouldn't forget the pawn ram g4-g5 is available on the kingside. --- Let's
imagine} 16. a5 {is played.} -- ({. Now if Black leaves his queen on d4 and
simply waits, moving his pieces backwards and forwards, here's how White might
build up his game until he wins material:} 16... Rfe8 17. Bf3 Bf8 18. Kg2 {

unpin the e-pawn, so that White can play e2-e4. Here Nh4 serves the purpose of
clearing the way for f2-f4, rather than with the express intention of making a
favourable exchange for the black bishop. --- Here's an example of this
strategy enjoying a startling success in the game A. Wirig-E.Postny, French
League 2013:} Be7 10. e4 dxe4 11. dxe4 O-O 12. Kh2 Ne8 {(directed against
White's central expansion with f2-f4; Black threatens 13...Bxh4, and if the
knight retreats to f3, the f-pawn is blocked)} 13. Bf3 $5 {(therefore White
decides to exchange off bishops instead)} Bxf3 14. Ndxf3 $1 {. The exchange of
bishops has allowed White's other knight to get to f3. He is still unable to
advance the f-pawn, but it has facilitated the development of his queenside.
Left undisturbed he can develop his bishop, and then play Rd1. In some cases
e4-e5 will increase his space advantage. Not liking any of this, Postny lashed
out with} g5 $2 15. Ng2 Ng7 16. Bd2 f5 $2 {. It can't be good to lunge
forwards with the black kingside pawns when White is better developed and the
centre is wide open. Black, the much higher-rated player (2627 Elo versus his
opponent's 2490) has lost patience against the King's Indian Attack, and that
is always fatal. It soon fell apart for him:} 17. exf5 exf5 18. Bc3 {(who

the opponent's kingside?)} Qe8 19. Rd1 Rd8 20. Qe3 h6 21. Bxg7 Kxg7 22. Nd4 Nc5

fought on to move 72 before resigning.})) 7. Nxg6 hxg6 {QUESTION: Should White
worry about his king being attacked the open h-file? --- ANSWER: As a general
rule, you should always worry about your king's safety during a game, but not
too much. Here the risk to White is very minimal. The f2-g3-h2 shell around
his king is solid and his bishop is taking care of the light squares. His
knight will go to f3 via d2, further strengthening his defences. And,
crucially, Black's pieces aren't on aggressive squares near the white king,
and he has no pawn advances available to open up lines. Whilst I could just
about imagine Nakamura conducting a brilliant attack if he were playing Black
here, he would need the help of some bad moves by White.} 8. Nd2 Nbd7 9. e4
dxe4 10. dxe4 e5 {Already we see that Black is missing his light-squared
bishop. Advancing the pawn to e5 stops White gaining more space and keeps the
bishop on g2 shut in, but it exposes the soft underbelly of the black centre
along the a2-g8 and h3-c8 diagonals.} 11. Qe2 Bc5 12. Nf3 Qc7 13. h4 $1 {
EXERCISE: Can you give some reasons why Nakamura chooses to push his h-pawn
rather than develop a piece? --- ANSWER: If the situation in the centre is
quiet we don't need to rush our development to hold on to key squares or ward
off threats. Here, as is often the case in the KIA, there is a fixed centre
pawn structure, with pawns on e4 and e5 blocking each other, and no violent
disturbance looming down the d-file. Therefore we are permitted - and required
- to use our wing pawns in an imaginative manner. --- By playing 13 h4,
Nakamura: 1) Secures an open diagonal for his bishop from h3-c8. --- 2)
Creates a base on g5 for his knight. --- 3) Empowers a future kingside attack
with an h4-h5 advance. --- If Black chooses to castle queenside, then the
white pawns can quickly become an attacking force with 14 c3 and 15 b4, etc,
gaining time by attacking the bishop on c5. In contrast, Black's kingside
pawns are static, a fact emphasised by 13 h4. White would therefore have all
the aces if it came to a kingside versus queenside attack. --- In the game

$1 {QUESTION: Rather than continue his attacking build-up on the kingside with,
say, 17 Rh1, Nakamura makes an irrelevant-looking pawn move on the queenside.
Why? --- ANSWER: Black's position is highly unpleasant, but it will take some
effort for White to win the game. His task would be greatly eased if Black can
be cajoled into weakening himself further. --- Chess players like to carry out
a plan, but anything Black tries to do will make matters worse for him. So
Nakamura waits with 17 a3, in effect saying to his opponent: 'How do you
propose to free your game?'. As we shall see, Solak decides to get rid of the
knight on g5 with ...N8h7. He might have avoided this idea if White had
'frightened' him with 17 Rh1. Instead, Nakamura develops his pieces quietly,
and waits for Black to play ...N8h7 and ...Nxg5, when the win becomes easier
for him.} ({If Black had played} 17. a3 N8h7 {at once, then} 18. Rh1 {threatens

ANSWER:} 26. g4 $3 {In its own way I regard this move as beautiful as a queen
sacrifice. It shows imagination to utilize the g-pawn - I suspect the
possibility wouldn't occur to 99% of players. Nakamura defends his rook with
the g-pawn, so that he acquires a strong passed pawn after 26...Rxh5 27 gxh5.

h-file.} Rdg8 27. Kf3 $1 {Black threatened to win a rook with 27...Rxh5.

the queenside to bypass an ...a5-a4 by Black with b3-b4, as seen, for example,
in the Malakhov-Potkin game above. --- The idea of attacking White's king with
...h7-h5 doesn't occur very often in the KIA Slav. Black often castles
kingside fairly quickly so the opportunity doesn't arise as a middlegame plan.
In any case, the centre and queenside aren't particularly hospitable for the
black king, so even if he has delayed castling, the plan of ...h7-h5 stores up
trouble for the future: if his kingside pawns are broken up, where is the
black monarch going to live?}) 7. e4 dxe4 8. dxe4 Bg4 {EXERCISE: How should

subtle loss of time. In the game, White drives the bishop back with h2-h3, a
useful move as he wants to guard the g4-square and play Kh2. By playing 9 f3
and later f3-f4 he will have lost the tempi he used for h2-h3. Besides, it
could be argued that the white queen is better on e1 than d1 as she defends e4.
}) 9... Nbd7 10. Nc3 Bc5 {I hope you are starting to get a feel for these type
of positions. They appear very balanced, with space being equal and both sides
having a more or less trouble-free development. However, when we look more
closely we notice some important features that give White, if not the better
game, then at least more chances to carry out an effective plan in the future.
--- EXERCISE: Going back to basics, can you describe the 'important features'
I'm talking about? --- ANSWER: Clearly, I'm not talking about the superficial
activity of the players' pieces, because the figures aren't very attractive
for White: Total number of squares the black bishops can move to without being
captured: 8. --- Total number of squares the white bishops can move to without
being captured: 1. --- So the black bishops control eight times more squares
than the white bishops. But so what? The closed nature of the position means
that is better to have pieces on their long-term optimal squares rather than
developed quickly. --- Looking at the pawn structure, White has the potential
to gain space with f2-f4, whilst Black has no equivalent pawn lever. Here we
see the value of the pawn on g3 - after a future ...e5xf4 in response to f2-f4,
the recapture g3xf4 is possible, keeping the white centre intact and mobile.
So we see that the move 2 g3 wasn't just a question of 'get the g-pawn out of
the way so that I can play Bg2' - the g3-pawn is an important strategic asset
due to its support of a future f2-f4. Another good point to g2-g3 is that it
stops Black ever playing ...Nf4, unless as a sacrifice, of course. In contrast,
White can play Nf5, as in most situations the preventive pawn move ...g7-g6
would loosen the black kingside too much as there's no bishop on g7 equivalent
to White's bishop on g2. --- The bishop on g2 is shut in, and will stay shut
in on g2 until the end of the game. It will have no attacking value at all.
But it guards the e4-pawn and, due to its enormous defensive power in
shielding the king, gives us the freedom to play moves like f2-f4, knowing
that after ...e5xf4 the recapture g3xf4 won't leave the white king exposed to
terrible danger. By bolstering the e4-pawn, no frontal attack by a black rook
or the queen will endanger the pawn on e4. --- Now look at Black's position.
Even if he managed to get the knight on f6 out of the way, the advance ...f7-f5 would after e4xf5 leave him with a weak pawn on e5 and a hole on e4,
besides giving the white bishop on e4 more scope. Assuming Black has castled
kingside, if he played ...g7-g6 and ...f7-f5, he would be exposing his king to
terrible danger - there is no black bishop on g7 to act as bodyguard to the
monarch. --- So we see that strategically speaking the white bishop on g2 is
better placed than the black bishop on c5, despite the latter controlling a
lot more squares. --- The bishop on c5 is stopping the advance of the f-pawn,
but it is only a temporary inconvenience for White, whereas his strategic
superiority is permanent. White could play an immediate Kh1 and then f2-f4,
but we aren't in a hurry. The bishop on g2 gives us a licence to utilize all
our pawns on the kingside. We want to get the h-pawn involved in our
initiative. And so:} 11. h3 {It doesn't follow that a piece is on a good
square just because it is actively placed. Likewise, a piece can be on a
passive square, but strategically well placed. The black bishop on g4 is
proving a bit of a liability, allowing White to gain more space on the
kingside.} Be6 {The bishop decides to retreat to the centre.} ({After} 11...
Bh5 12. Kh2 {Black would have to reckon with} -- 13. f4 {when ideas of} -- 14.
g4 Bg6 15. f5 {, trapping the bishop, loom. Or even the less direct 14 f5
would leave Black unable to extricate the bishop from the threat of 15 g4.})
12. Kh2 {QUESTION: Why would h2 be chosen rather than h1? --- ANSWER: White
normally plays Kh2 in games I've seen with this type of centre. It gets the
king off the back rank in case White ever wants to put a rook or the queen on
h1, for example, and adds a defender to h3 and g3. The main drawback to Kh2 is
if Black ever finds an effective way to sacrifice his knight with a ...Nxg4+
style sacrifice, which could happen if White has carelessly pushed his pawn to
g4.} O-O 13. f4 {At last White achieves the desired pawn advance. Black has
nothing to match it - he can generate a lot of sound and fury on the queenside
with his pieces, but there is no equivalent support from his pawns. --- Black
is again threatened with the loss of his bishop to 14 f5. Note that the
exchange 13...exf4? 14 gxf4 is strategically totally unappealing for Black. It
should only be made if Black has a strong tactical follow-up to undermine the
white centre pawns. Black would have surrendered his pawn bastion on e5, the
strategic linchpin in his centre. White's pawns would already be threatening
to overwhelm him by advancing and the pent-up energy of the white pieces would
be unleashed. Not that White would have to hurry, there would be no way for
Black to re-establish a pawn centre to hold back the white pawns and pieces.
--- It would be a different story if Black played 13...exf4 and White made the
catastrophic recapture 14 Rxf4??. Then he wouldn't have a pair of mobile pawns
in the centre. Black could play 14...Ne5, putting the knight on an ideal
central blockade square, or he could target the g3-pawn with moves like ...Bd6,
...Nh5 and ...Qc7. White would be facing a quick defeat. He we see the value
of 2 g3 extends far beyond freeing the g2-square for the bishop, or defending
the f4-square against invasion by a black knight. The pawn has to be available
to go to f4 after ...e5xf4, or White's whole strategy fails. --- Notice that
after the recapture 14 gxf4 White is strategically winning, but after the
recapture 14 Rxf4 Black is winning.} Nb6 {Making an escape square for the

QUESTION: That's a long variation. How can I possibly work it out during a

it's rarely good for Black to combine ...Bf5 with an early ...e7-e5. So your
tactical nose should already be sniffing. --- Moreover, most of the moves are
captures, aren't they? That makes it much easier. It means there are fewer
branches of the combination to worry about - it's almost a straight line.

further narrows down your focus. As long as you are aware of the potential pin
of the black queen and king after a mass of exchanges, the combination can be
unravelled.}) 9. e4 $1 {I guess this move isn't exactly a surprise after

Speaking from a static viewpoint, White has more space and the two bishops.

this so? Because the knight on f8 hinders the co-operation of the black pieces.
--- White must advance somewhere if he is to win.} ({Regarding option 'c' it

{The 'Slav' method of countering the King's Indian Attack entails Black
putting pawns on d5 and c6 to blunt the activity of White's bishop on g2, and
quickly developing his own light-squared bishop. In the previous chapter we
looked at what happens if the bishop goes to f5. Now it is time to examine ...Bg4.} 1. Nf3 -- ({The bishop can be developed to g4 at any time after Black
has played ...d7-d5: for example,} 1... d5 2. g3 Bg4 (2... c6 3. Bg2 Bg4)) ({or
} 1... Nf6 2. g3 d5 3. Bg2 c6 4. O-O Bg4 {. In playing ...Bg4 Black removes
the bishop from the defence of the queenside, in particular the b7-pawn. In
the Reti Opening, White often responds with a quick c2-c4, perhaps in
combination with Qb3 and Ne5, to try to exploit this. As this is the King's
Indian Attack we won't be examining such lines, but it is worth remembering
you have this option if you plan to broaden your opening repertoire or want to
play a bit more aggressively. Another approach for White not examined here
would be to play d2-d4 rather than d2-d3, leading to a different type of pawn
centre. --- In the KIA versus the Caro-Kann, after the moves 1 e4 c6 2 d3
Black often chooses a set-up with ...d7-d5 and, after White's Nf3, ...Bg4.
This makes the game 'Slav-like'. The reader is therefore invited to study Game
14 of Chapter Three when looking at Part Two of the present chapter (...d5xe4
by Black). Game 17 in that chapter might also be worth playing through. ---
Black has a choice of three pawn centres: From the position above, a typical
sequence is} 5. d3 Nbd7 6. Nbd2 {. Now Black can arrange his pawn structure in
one of three ways.} -- ({. Firstly, Black can take all the space on offer by
playing ...e7-e5 and keeping a broad centre with a pawn on d5. For example,} 
6... e5 7. e4 Bc5 {. If Black can get away with this then White needs a new
opening. So we need the precise} ({the second option for Black is to equalize
the space balance in the centre by playing ...e7-e5 as above, but meeting
White's e2-e4 pawn advance by exchanging with ...d5xe4. In this way he has
fewer commitments in the centre and won't need to give up the bishop-pair.
Play could go} 7... dxe4 8. dxe4 Be7 9. Qe1 O-O 10. Nc4 Qc7 {. The central
pawn structure is symmetrical and Black's pieces are all developed, but he has
conceded the c4-square to the white knight and opened the d-file, which allows
White to keep a slight edge in Game 29}) 8. h3 $1 Bxf3 {(Black would be ill
advised to avoid this exchange, as made clear in the analysis to Game 28 below)
} 9. Qxf3 O-O {. Black has full development and has stood his ground in the
centre, but White has the two bishops and pressure on d5. This scenario is
examined in Game 28.}) ({. The third possibility for Black is to renounce the
chance to equalize space in the centre and make do with ...e7-e6, which
completes the Slav triangle of pawns. It is the most solid but least ambitious
move. From the second diagram above, play might proceed} 6... e6 7. b3 Bc5 8.
Bb2 O-O 9. a3 a5 10. e4 b5 11. Qe1 {. White has achieved e2-e4, completed his
development by fianchettoing his bishop on b2, and kept a minimal space
advantage on the kingside. Black, for his part, has active pieces and is
looking for counterplay on the queenside. This is the beginning of Game 31.
--- Black is quite close to being equal in these scenarios, but White always
retains a plus if he plays precisely. He can use his little space advantage,
the two bishops, or better coordinated pieces as the starting point of a plan
to slowly grind down his opponent.})) ({White harasses the bishop on g4 with
his pawns: Finally White can try to benefit from a rapid advance of his
kingside pawns. In Game 32 after} 1... d5 2. g3 -- (2... Bg4 3. Bg2 Nd7 4. h3 {
(very early), Black cut across his opponent's plans with the immediate} Bxf3 {
leading to a unusual Slav/King's Indian Defence hybrid after} 5. Bxf3 Ngf6 6.
d3 c6 7. Nd2 g6 {.}) ({. Play is sharper if Black retreats his bishop to h5:
for example,} 2... Nf6 3. Bg2 Bg4 4. d3 c6 5. Nbd2 e6 6. h3 Bh5 ({the move} 
6... Bxf3 {is less attractive now that White can recapture with the knight}) 7.
g4 Bg6 8. Nh4 {. This is the way Nakamura plays as white in Game 33. He hopes
to use his kingside pawns in a direct attack if Black castles kingside, or to
profit from the elimination of Black's light-squared bishop after Nxg6.
White's scheme is, however, double-edged, especially if Black has played a
move order with 5...Nbd7 - see Game 34. Such loose play might not appeal to
'purists' who are looking for a steady advantage in the KIA.}) ({. A note on
move order: After White's standard opening sequence} 2... c6 3. Bg2 Bg4 4. O-O
Nd7 5. d3 Ngf6 {it is usual to play} 6. Nbd2 {to support the e2-e4 advance.} ({
However, Kramnik has tried the finesse} 6. Qe1 {which aims to avoid Black's
solid ...e7-e6 system. --- You might like to copy the former World Champion's
approach in Game 30.}))) *

of this type of pawn structure in Part Two of the chapter.}) ({QUESTION: How
should we play if Black develops his bishop to d6 to further support the
e5-pawn? --- ANSWER: Quite reasonable is the reply 7 b3 and 8 Bb2. However, on
d6 the bishop is a knight's move away from the weakest point in the black
centre - the f5-square. Therefore I like the plan of getting a white horse
there as quickly as possible: for example,} 7... Bd6 8. h3 Bh5 9. -- (9. Qe1 {

Nevertheless, it turns out that Black didn't achieve his space rich and active

after all moves second, is able to maintain an optimum centre and activate his
pieces on their best squares, we might as well give up on the King's Indian
Attack. However, it turns out that the black centre is still somewhat fragile,
and the fact that Black hasn't castled tells against him. We have, though, to
be prepared to play sharply, to break open the centre. It isn't good enough to
play typical 'quiet' King's Indian Attack moves, which support the strongpoint

to castle, while White easily regains the pawn on d4 with Nxd4 at some point.

on f3. That's why we need the 8 h3 move.})) 9. Qxf3 O-O {QUESTION: Can we
exploit the fact that White's light-squared bishop has no rival? --- ANSWER:}
10. exd5 $1 cxd5 11. c4 {A move such as 10 exd5 should never be played lightly.
White gives up the strongpoint on e4 which he is so keen to overprotect in
similar King's Indian Attack variations. --- As a rule, such an idea is only
good if White wins material or has a concrete variation planned (as in the
notes to 8 h3 above), or, as here (and after 7...Bd6 in the above analysis to
7...Bc5), he wants to open a line for his bishop on g2 in the absence of the
opponent's light-squared bishop. Don't forget that the technical expression
for a move like 10 exd5 contains a hint of criticism: it is 'conceding the
centre'. So be wary before taking the plunge.} dxc4 ({White also keeps up the
pressure after} 11... Rc8 12. cxd5 Nb6 13. Ne4 Nbxd5 14. Bg5 {.}) 12. Nxc4 {
The white pawn on d3, though formally isolated and backward, provides a post
for the white horse on c4 where it can attack e5 and cast a malign eye over
the black queenside. Meanwhile Black's pawn on e5 supports a potentially
excellent outpost square for one of his nags, but unfortunately neither are
near to it.} Rb8 13. Bd2 b5 {It is easy to criticise this move as it invites
the white knight to infiltrate the black queenside as far as c6,} ({but after
a quiet sequence such as} 13... Bd4 14. Rfe1 Re8 15. Rac1 Nb6 16. Ba5 {Black
remains in an unpleasant bind.}) 14. Na5 Qb6 {EXERCISE: With his queen and
minor pieces on good squares, what is the next step in increasing White's
advantage?} 15. b4 $1 Bd4 16. Rac1 {White seizes the only open file on the
board, for if 16...Rfc8 then 17 Nc6, threatening both the rook on b8 and 18
Ne7+ is very awkward for Black. Note how this conforms with the adage that a
player with the better minor pieces wins control of an open file.} Qe6 17. Rc2
Rbc8 18. Rfc1 Rxc2 19. Rxc2 h6 {EXERCISE: Now which piece should White try to
exchange off in order to exploit his queenside pressure, and how should he
prepare it? --- ANSWER:} 20. Be1 $1 Re8 21. Qc6 $1 {One of the hallmarks of a
supreme positional understanding is to know which pieces to exchange off and
which to keep on the board. Pantsulaia realizes that his queen is only getting
in the way of his light-squared bishop, whereas the black queen is well
centralized and blocking any progress along the c-file (for example, 21 Rc6
leaves the a2-pawn hanging). --- Note too that a great feel for chess ideas
has to be combined with tactical accuracy. If White had played 20 Qc6 at once
then 20...Qf5! hits both d3 and f2, when White would do best to retreat his
queen back with 21 Qf3 and then try something else after 21...Qe6. And so
before the queen goes to c6 we have the prelude 20 Be1! to guard f2, so that
after 20...Re8 21 Qc6 Qf5 White can defend d3 with 22 Qxb5 and be a pawn up.
--- You think the bishop looks a bit odd on e1? I agree! But we have to
remember that a flexible use of the pieces is important in any opening, and is
especially significant in the King's Indian Attack. White often gets no space
advantage, so you have to be aware of all possible squares for the pieces. The
bishop may look odd retreating to e1, but it is this passive move that allows
White to invade enemy territory with 21 Qc6.} e4 $2 {A common scenario in the
King's Indian Attack. Black tries for counterplay, but it is easily
neutralized, whereupon he ends up a pawn down in the endgame. It often happens
that a player loses patience and lashes out when under nagging pressure. In
contrast, if the same player is in tactical danger, say facing a big attack on
their king, they will rise to the occasion and find great defensive moves. For
this reason it is easy to underestimate White's practical winning chances in
the King's Indian Attack. A computer program might tell you that a position is
equal, but it could be one that is psychologically difficult for a human to
play. Incidentally a lot of Magnus Carlsen's wins occur when he plays on and
on in positions where he has a slight edge until his opponent 'cracks'.} ({

d5 2. g3 c6 3. Bg2 Bg4 4. O-O Nd7 5. d3 e5 {Move order is a tricky thing, even
in so-called 'quiet' openings. As we shall see in the next note, playing ...e7-e5
so early means that Black can be practically compelled to exchange with ...d5xe4 if White desires it.} 6. e4 {And why not? White can play this advance
immediately as there is no black knight on f6 to oppose it.} ({Now if Black
continues with} 6. e4 Ngf6 {, White can transpose to Game 28 above with} 7.
Nbd2 {, but he isn't obliged to.} ({Indeed,} 7. Qe1 {reaches Game 30 (which
had the move order 5...Ngf6 6 Qe1 e5 7 e4). Black is then more or less forced
to concede the centre with} dxe4 8. dxe4 {because of White's potential
pressure on e5 (why this is so is explained in the notes to Game 30). --- The
conclusion is therefore that if Black wants to maintain pawns on d5 and e5, he
needs to choose a move order as in Game 28, which began 1 Nf3 d5 2 g3 c6 3 Bg2
Bg4 4 0-0 Nf6 5 d3 Nbd7 6 Nbd2 e5 7 e4. That is, he brings out the knight on
f6 quickly so that White has to play 6 Nbd2 to arrange 7 e4, rather than
advance e2-e4 at once, and he waits until move six to play ...e7-e5.})) 6...
dxe4 7. dxe4 Ngf6 8. Nbd2 {It is very rare in the ...Bg4 system for this not
to be the right way to start the knight's career. Here it is particularly
appetising as the knight has access to the c4-square now that Black has played
...d5xe4.} Be7 {EXERCISE: Which move adds the most power to the white
position? --- ANSWER:} 9. Qe1 ({Not bad is} 9. h3 {, but this little queen
move frees both her knights for action by breaking the pin on f3 and adding to
the defence of the e4-pawn.}) 9... O-O {The advance ..e7-e5 leaves the
f5-square as the least defended in the black camp. In the King's Indian, and
some lines of the Closed Ruy Lopez, Black plays ...g7-g6, combined with ...Bg7,
to guard the f5-square against an invasion by a white knight. Here Black
doesn't have the time or opportunity to play ...g7-g6 and ...Bg7, unless he is
prepared to give up the bishop-pair with an early ...Bxf3 (as we shall see in
Game 32), and possibly not even then. --- QUESTION: From the above assessment
it is clear that White wants to put a knight on f5. Which horse should we use,
the one on d2 or the one on f3? --- ANSWER:} 10. Nc4 {Generally speaking, the
knight on d2 is more passively placed than the one on f3, so giving it
preference over the knight on f3 makes sense. Getting it out of the way also
facilitates the development of the bishop on c1 and the rook on a1. --- If we
count the moves, it takes three moves to get the knight from d2 via c4 and e3
to f5, while only two are required to get the knight from f3 via h4 to f5.
However, paradoxically, you could argue that the knight gets there from d2
faster as the moves 10 Nc4 and 11 Ne3 both come with a threat. Let's see how
this works out in the game.} Qc7 {Dealing with the attack on e5.} 11. Ne3 Bh5 (
{If now} 11... Nxe4 {the bishop on g4 drops}) ({while} 11... Be6 $6 12. Ng5 {
intends 13 Nxe6 to smash up Black's pawns and obtain the bishop-pair.}) ({
Perhaps he should hand over the bishop-pair at once with} 11... Bxf3 12. Bxf3 {
.}) 12. Nf5 Nc5 ({Instead} 12... Bc5 {, keeping the bishop, looks a better try.
}) 13. Nxe7+ {QUESTION: It's funny how we might spend two or even three moves
getting a knight to an excellent square, but then we don't hesitate to
exchange it for a bishop that's not doing much. Is this exchange really
correct? --- ANSWER: True, it does seem a bit odd. But don't forget the
blocked centre is just the first phase of the game. If we want to make
progress as White we need to open up lines at some point, and then Black's
dark-squared bishop becomes a potent piece. The dark-squared bishop is also a
key piece in any plan Black devises, so he'll miss it if it's exchanged.
Besides, we have another knight waiting to go to f5 - it's only right it gets
its turn as well.} Qxe7 14. Nh4 Ne6 {EXERCISE: You are invited to weigh up the
relative merits of the pawn moves 15 f3 and 15 c3. Which one looks more
natural to you at first glance, and does your opinion change as you delve more
deeply?} 15. f3 $1 {ANSWER: We've seen a lot of c2-c3 moves in this type of
structure, and relatively few f2-f3 moves, but therein lies a trap that is
sometimes described as 'stereotyped thinking'. If we're feeling tired or a bit
lazy, it's tempting to avoid the mental effort required to assess the actual
position in front of us and instead rely on what 'looks right', the type of
move we've seen many times before.} ({We might also be provoked into} 15. c3 {
by fear: namely that the black knight will invade on d4 with} Nd4 {, when
there would be the tactical threat of 16...Nxc2, as well as the positional
threat of 16...Ne2+ and then 17...Nxc1, depriving us of the strong bishop. Our
stereotyped thinking would be reinforced by anxiety. --- The move 15 f3! has
many plusses if we can overcome our sense of a certain ugliness: 1) It
prepares a deployment of the bishop to e3 without it being driven back by ...Ng4 - an exchange of the bishop for knight would be unwelcome for White. --- 2)
It blocks the action of the bishop on h5 against d1, forestalling any possible
invasion by a black rook with ...Rad8 and ...Rd1. At the same time a square is
opened for the white rook on f2, where as we shall see, it can be used to
defend c2 and later is able to join in the struggle for the d-file. --- 3) The
final good point about 15 f3 is something it doesn't do: namely it doesn't
weaken the d3-square. In positions with a fixed centre pawn structure a keen
positional battle often takes place along the open file adjacent to the pawns.
Weakening a square inside his own camp along the key line with 15 c3 is
thoughtless, and encourages an invasion with ...Nc5 and ...Nd3, or ...Rad8 and
...Rd3.}) 15... Qc5+ 16. Rf2 Qb6 17. b3 {Paradoxically, this move doesn't show
an intent to fianchetto. Instead, White is saving the b-pawn from being
captured after he puts his bishop on e3.} a5 18. Be3 Qb4 19. c3 {Only now does
White avail himself of the chance to play c2-c3, when it drives the black
queen away with a gain of tempo. Besides, White's pieces will be the first to
get to the d-file, so the hole created on d3 is no longer a relevant
positional factor.} Qa3 {The King's Indian Attack is more effective in
practice than the assessment of a computer program would have us believe.
Computers don't get bored or frustrated, whereas humans like to be doing
something active; it is against our nature to defend passively for many moves
without the guidance of a plan. Black often runs out of constructive ideas in
this type of centre. Thus both here and in Game 28 in Chapter Five we see a
very strong player losing patience and engaging in an adventure with their
queen that removes her from the defence of the black camp.} 20. Rd1 Rfd8 21.
Rxd8+ Rxd8 {EXERCISE: Have a good look at the position and try to decide
White's best strategy. He will need to rearrange his pieces, but how? ---
ANSWER:} 22. Rd2 $1 {White's plan is simple. He wants to restrain Black's
possible counterplay along the d-file or on the kingside. Therefore he first
of all contests the open file, driving the black rook away. Then he will
manoeuvre his knight to the centre, being careful to keep the black minor
pieces at bay. Finally he will try to force Black to weaken his queenside
pawns.} Ra8 {EXERCISE: Should White now play 23 Qd1 to exert his queen's power
along the open file?} ({Black gives up the d-file without a fight as he has
decided it is the lesser evil to have the white rook controlling it rather
than the queen after} 22... Rxd2 23. Qxd2 {.}) 23. Nf5 {ANSWER: The next step

build-up? --- ANSWER:} 10. h3 $1 {This little move is virtually always a key
part of White's opening strategy in the ...Bg4 system. It forces the black

29 White had got his knight to c4 without playing h2-h3. Therefore the first

of time by attacking the bishop which was still on g4.} ({In contrast, after}

White? --- ANSWER: After the simple game move, White really is threatening 17
gxf4 as after 17...exf4 18 Bf2 Black no longer has the killer pawn thrust ...f4-f3. It therefore forces Black to exchange his attacking knight for the
passive white bishop on g2. Of course, in some structures it would be a
positional concession, perhaps a serious one, for White to concede the
exchange of his 'Indian' bishop for the knight. But here the position is very
blocked and static, and White will have a grip on the centre, so the exchange
favours him. --- That's the first good point about 16 f3. Another is that it
defends the e4-pawn, so that 16...Nxg2 and 17...Nxe4 no longer wins a pawn for
Black. And, thirdly, it shuts in the bishop on h5 and so allows a white rook

wrong with the alternative plan of preparing f2-f4. Doesn't it fit the
strategic requirements of the position? --- Well, when you see the power of
White's f-pawn later in this game it is hard to argue against the plan of
advancing the kingside pawns. The trouble is that the King's Indian Attack
requires a lot of jockeying for position. At the moment Black's pieces are
well coordinated and he has queenside counterplay. A frontal attack with f2-f4
has little chance of working against a world champion unless he has been
weakened somehow. That's why Sasikiran tries to force a favourable resolution
of the queenside battle before turning his attention to the kingside. He knows
he mustn't hurry; that would be fatal against Anand. --- In the two previous
examples of the position after 13...Nc7, White tried a direct approach, but it

moral is that if you are patient and don't hurry to carry out a plan, it might
become more effective, even if your opponent doesn't make a mistake. It might
simply be because he has to manoeuvre his pieces according to his own plan -

remind ourselves that there are more possibilities in the position than are
contained in the King's Indian Attack. Thus Kasimdzhanov might have been
deterred from playing 4...Bh5 because of White changing track with c2-c4: for
example, 5 0-0 c6 6 d3 e5 7 c4 with pressure on d5 which the light-squared
bishop can't help counter as it is out of things on h5. It's good to master

Naturally White mustn't be allowed to play 10 e5.} 10. Bg2 O-O {QUESTION: Is

b3 $4 Nxe4 12. dxe4 Bxa1 {wins for Black.}) 11... e5 {Black builds a full
centre. You might like to compare the situation here with Game 17 in Chapter
Three where Black fianchettoed on g7 and then satisfied himself with ...e7-e6.}
12. b3 {Now that the a1-h8 diagonal is closed White can safely fianchetto.}
Rfe8 13. Bb2 Rad8 14. Rfe1 {White has deployed his pieces in a familiar manner:
both bishops are fianchettoed and he has supported his e4 point with no less
than five units. He has avoided playing c2-c3 as this would weaken the d3-pawn
and shut in his bishop on b2 - besides, it would be an utterly pointless move.
--- In reply Black has safeguarded his king and developed all his pieces to
good-looking squares. There are no weaknesses in his pawn structure. The only
potential target in his camp is the pawn on e5, as it cannot easily be
defended by another pawn - arranging ...f7-f6 would be disruptive, too costly
in time and involve a weakening of Black's light squares. However the pawn on
e5 is well looked after by the black pieces: it is directly defended three
times and the bishop on g7 is also ready to come to its aid. Nor is Black
suffering from a space disadvantage. White has the bishop-pair, but this is
hardly an important factor at the moment. --- So far Black has been able to
make 'easy' developing moves. I hope it isn't being immodest to say that you
or I could have made exactly the same moves as the former FIDE World Champion.
Black develops, centralizes, and looks after his centre pawns; there is no
mystery here. --- But now we have reached the early middlegame stage, and
Black has to make his first important strategic decision. This is normally the
hardest part of any game of chess, and any decision taken is particularly
critical in an opening like the King's Indian Attack, where in view of the
slow, strategic nature of the play a change in the nature of the pawn
structure can reverberate well into the endgame. --- EXERCISE: So let me ask
you to examine the position for a while and decide whether Black should play
14...d4 or 14...dxe4. Which move do you like the most? What are the pros and
cons of each move?} d4 {EXERCISE: After 14...d4, can you see a way to increase
the power of the bishop on g2?} ({ANSWER: The plus points of} 14... dxe4 {are
that after} 15. dxe4 {the frontal pressure is off the pawn on e5: if the black
knight wanders from d7 there is no chance of being surprised by e4xd5,
uncovering the white queen and rook against the e5-pawn followed by Bxe5. ---
This means that the black knight on d7 is relieved of its defensive duty: for
example, there is now the plan of ...Nc5, perhaps followed by ...Ne6, aiming
for ...Nd4. If White responded to ...Ne6 with c2-c3 he shuts in his bishop and
weakens the d3-square. Black's rook is the first to sit on the newly opened
d-file, and whilst it is hard to imagine that he will ever be able to attack
along it, his potential pressure means that White would probably have to allow
the exchange of both pairs of rooks along it, after which his winning chances
would be rather small. --- The drawback to 14...dxe4 15 dxe4 is that White's
knight gains access to the c4-square. Because Black has fianchettoed, the
d6-square is a potential weakness. For example, White could build up with
moves like a2-a4, to deter ...b7-b5, then Nc4, Ba3, and Rad1, aiming for an
invasion with Nd6. On the kingside, h3-h4 and Bh3 would increase the scope of
the light-squared bishop.}) 15. h4 $1 {ANSWER: If you play the King's Indian
Attack, you have to be alert to ways of activating your pieces on the wings,
as the centre is often clogged up with pawns. Here Morozevich not only clears
the h3-square for his bishop, but also introduces the idea of h4-h5, nibbling
at Black's kingside, if the black knight leaves f6.} Nc5 {Black's plan is to
gain more space on the queenside with a general advance of his pawns.} 16. Bh3

19...axb3 20 axb3 Ra8 or the immediate 19...Ra8. Which do you prefer?} Ra8 {
Black is tempted to keep the tension by avoiding the exchange of pawns on b3 -
he doesn't want the white rook to 'see daylight' on the a-file. But the game
move is actually a serious mistake; in fact it is probably the decisive
strategic mistake.} ({ANSWER: Instead, after} 19... axb3 $1 20. axb3 Ra8 {
Black keeps the balance. White can't play} 21. Rac1 $2 {without allowing an
infiltration of his second rank with} Ra2 {.}) 20. b4 $1 {...the a-file and
b-file are blocked. This means that White has time to arrange Rac1 and c2-c4
to blast open the c-file.} Ne6 21. Rac1 Rad8 {The rook scurries back to the
centre, but it is too late. --- EXERCISE: White wants to open a line of attack
against the pawn on c6, but if he plays 22 c4 at once Black's knight on e6
will have access to the d4 -square after 22...dxc3. What preliminary measure
should White take to deny the black horse access to this ideal post? ---
ANSWER:} 22. Ng5 $1 {White could have eliminated the knight on e6 with 22 Bxe6.
I've seen players make an exchange of this nature, so it's by no means always
a crazy idea. Black doesn't have a light-squared bishop of his own to exploit
the absence of White's bishop, so the white king would remain pretty secure
after its exchange. And it could be argued in this semi-blocked position that
the black knight is of more value than the white bishop. But such reasoning
doesn't stand up in this specific case. White wants to keep his bishop because
it is helping to keep Black under pressure.} ({Moreover, the game move obliges
the black knight to retreat due to the positional threat of 23 Nxe6 when after
23...fxe6 the black central pawn structure is hobbled. See how strong White's
light-squared bishop would be in that case. Or if} 22. Ng5 Nxg5 23. hxg5 {when

this plan with ...Rc8, etc.}) 24. Rxc3 N6d7 25. Rec1 Nb8 26. a3 h6 27. Nf3 Ne6
28. Be3 Rd6 {EXERCISE: Is there a way to increase White's advantage? ---
ANSWER: Due to the mistake 19...Ra8, Black's queenside pawns have become a
dead mass rather than a source of counterplay. The black knight on b8 is tied
down to the defence of the c6-pawn, hampering the coordination of the black
pieces. --- The centre and queenside are fairly blocked, meaning Black can
hold on OK there. Besides, it makes sense to start an attack as far away as
possible from the passive knight on b8. Morozevich understands that he should
prepare an assault on the kingside based on the pawn stab with h4-h5. However,
he realizes he doesn't have to hurry and for the next ten moves he manoeuvres
his pieces around, seemingly unable to decide the best squares to have them on
when staging the breakthrough. Of course, it is one long nightmare for
Kasimdzhanov who can only wait for the axe to fall.} 29. Qd2 Kh7 30. Kg2 Red8

think of White's plan of advancing his kingside pawns?} ({ANSWER: Here's my
opinion. If Black plays} 5... e6 {as in the previous game, I'm happy with the

you forget about the pawn roller and play} 6. O-O {when} e5 7. e4 {transposes
to Game 28 above. --- This is because of the 8...e5! advance discussed in the
notes to 8...e6 below. If Black has already gone 5...e6, the idea of playing
the pawn to e5 is less effective because he is a tempo down, but with the move
order 5...Nbd7 it looks formidable. On the other hand, Svidler is willing to
adopt this line as White, so he must have a trick or two up his sleeve to
strengthen White's play.}) 6. h3 Bh5 7. g4 $5 Bg6 8. Nh4 e6 {A critical moment.
At first glance Black's modest pawn move seems very logical. He is going to be
deprived of his light-squared bishop, so he builds a solid centre with his

a much better idea for Black. Then White should reply} 9. e3 {with a

b-file.}) 12... Qa5 {QUESTION: What is the purpose of this move? Surely
Kramnik doesn't think the queen can hold up White's queenside assault by
herself? --- ANSWER: The former world champion wants to put his queen in front
of his dark-squared bishop along the b8-h2 diagonal to create threats against
the white king. He therefore moves his queen out of the way of the bishop to
a5, where she also slows down the white attack somewhat by guarding the
b4-square.} 13. a3 Bb8 14. f4 {QUESTION: What? I thought you said White was
going to attack on the queenside? --- ANSWER: That's right! The game move is
designed to prevent Black from gaining counterplay in the centre, as 14...e5
costs a piece after 15 f5. In other words, White is using the unfortunate
situation of the bishop on g6 to curtail Black's initiative. --- But Kramnik
is not to be thwarted:} e5 $6 {Anyway. Black jettisons the bishop to open
lines against the white king.} 15. f5 {The Noah's Ark Trap, in which a pawn

{In this chapter we analyse what happens if Black counters White's kingside
fianchetto by putting his bishop quickly on b7. A typical sequence is:} 1. Nf3
Nf6 2. g3 b6 ({After 1 Nf3 Nf6 2 g3 we examine the bold} 2... b5 $5 {- not a
bad move despite the drastic nature of the miniature given. --- In fact it is
positionally well motivated. In contrast to 2...b6, it doesn't allow White to
gain space with c2-c4. It is of course committal: the pawn is slightly
vulnerable to attack on b5 and limits some of Black's strategic options. For
example, looking ahead he won't have the option of castling queenside into a
safe structure as he sometimes does in the KIA versus the French scenarios.
--- After falling for a sneaky trap Black doesn't get much further than the
opening in Game 37. It's worth recalling the words of the great strategist
Réti: 'The foundation of positional play is tactics'. If you find you make
serious oversights, then put this book away and look at some puzzles of the
'White (or Black) to play and win variety'.}) 3. Bg2 Bb7 4. O-O e6 {Now 5 c4
or 5 d4 are natural moves when we're well on the way to a Queen's Indian main
line, but the way to keep it a King's Indian Attack is with:} 5. d3 $1 {In the
Queen's Indian proper with White committed to the advance 1 d4, Black is well
placed to fight for control of the e4-square. He does his best either to
prevent White from advancing e2-e4, or else weaken his position in some way to
achieve it. Here, however, White still has the option of supporting the e2-e4
advance with 5 d3, so the exertions of the black pieces alone can't prevent
White from conquering e4 with a pawn. --- QUESTION: Why should it matter that
much if White gets in d2-d3 and e2-e4? Can't Black just develop his pieces
like in a Sicilian Hedgehog with 5...Be7, 6...0-0, 7...d6, 8...c5, and 9...Nbd7? --- ANSWER: In the Sicilian Hedgehog Black has already reduced the
potential size of the white pawn centre on move three: after 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 d6
3 d4 cxd4 4 Nxd4 White is deprived of his d-pawn. In the King's Indian Attack
he can seek to build a full pawn centre in two waves: firstly with d2-d3 and
e2-e4, then, having secured the e4-pawn with moves like Re1 or Nbd2, he can
venture d3-d4. If Black has played ...c7-c5, the preliminary c2-c3 will ensure
that White can answer...c5xd4 with c3xd4, keeping a full pawn centre. --- For
this reason, Black can't sit back in the KIA and let White build a pawn centre.
He needs to make an immediate counter-thrust to fight for the e4-square.} d5 $1
6. Nbd2 {The knight is developed with a view to supporting an e2-e4 advance.}
Nbd7 {Here White has a choice.} 7. -- ({In Game 35 we look at White's
immediate action in the centre with} 7. e4 {(the slightly slower 7 Re1
intending e2-e4 can be found in the notes). This leads to very sharp but in my
opinion very promising play for White.}) ({However, it won't appeal to all
tastes, so in Game 36 we look at the more positional} 7. b3 {.}) *

$5 {QUESTION: What is White's compensation for the pawn? --- ANSWER: Black's
pieces are cramped, his bishop on e4 is under attack, and he is behind in
development, still two moves from castling. It will be difficult for Black to
challenge White's control of the d-file after he plays Rd1. Furthermore, the

stick to the KIA recipe of preparing e2-e4 if it doesn't fit the requirements
of the position. For example, after} 10. e3 Re8 11. Qe2 e5 {Black has managed
to build a big centre. Note this is only possible because he has played ...Bc5
rather than ...Be7 - with no bishop in the way on e7 the black rook on e8 is
able to support the ...e7-e5 advance. That's why facing ...Bc5 Minasian
rightly prefers to put pressure on d5 with 10 c4. The 'KIA' plan of e2-e4, if
needed, can wait until later.}) 10... Qe7 11. Qc2 Rfe8 12. e3 Rac8 {EXERCISE:
Have a go at assessing the position and see if you can find the best plan for
White. --- ANSWER: OK, let's compare notes. We're going to try to agree on a
good strategic plan for White. It seems difficult, but we can break it down
into some simple steps. Is the white pawn structure the more flexible? Yes. He
has four possible ways to change its nature: b3-b4, c4xd5, d3-d4 and e3-e4.
Meanwhile Black has ...d5xc4 and ...e6-e5. More flexibility doesn't
necessarily mean better chances - at this stage we're just noting that White
has more options when it comes to pawn moves to support a possible plan. ---
Are White's pieces better placed than Black's pieces? If you compare the
pieces one by one, there doesn't seem much of a difference: a white bishop on
g2 balances a black bishop on b7, and the knights on either side are on
similar squares. --- The first real difference we notice is the white queen on
c2 and rooks on a1 and f1 compared to a queen on e7 and rooks on c8 and e8.
This difference implies that the black heavy pieces are better poised for
action in the centre, whereas the white pieces would happier if the queenside
opened. --- But the major contrast is between the white bishop on b2,
inconspicuously tucked away on b2, and the black bishop on c5, which is as far
advanced as any black pawn. Whenever a piece is on an unusual square, it
should stir your imagination to find ways to exploit it. Why aren't pieces
normally advanced in front of the pawns? Because they are targets. --- We are
edging towards a possible plan. The white queen and rook on a1 would be better
placed for queenside action, the black rooks and queen would be better placed
for action in the centre. And then there is the black bishop on c5, just
asking to be kicked back by a white pawn.} ({After} 12... Rac8 13. d4 {the
bishop retreats to d6 when it's hard to see what White has achieved. He has
shut in his bishop on b2 and his centre is less flexible. The bishop is better
on d6 than c5. Now that it is out of the way, Black might counterattack with ...c7-c5, when the opposition of the white queen on c2 and the black rook on c8
could be awkward for White.} ({Let's think about} 13. e4 dxe4 14. dxe4 {and
now upon} e5 {(preventing the encroachment 15 e5), Black is solidly
centralized and we haven't been able to prove the bishop is bad on c5. A
positive point is that we can improve the bishop on g2 with the neat move Bh3,
indirectly putting more pressure on e5. But how can we progress after that? If
we try Nh4, aiming for Nf5, Black would keep the knight out of f5 with ...g6
when we have to worry about an invasion of the central dark squares with...Bd4.
--- So we should reject 13 e4, at least for the moment. Still, keep the move
Bh3 in mind: it's a way to prove that White's light-squared bishop has more
potential than its opposite number on b7. --- That brings us to thinking about
our queenside pawns, and with a bit of inspiration we might find the sequence
in the game.})) 13. cxd5 exd5 {Black had no choice.} ({He loses a piece after

grandmaster and, realizing that this pawn advance would be a strong move if
allowed 'for free', has taken the precaution of guarding the b4-square with
three pieces: the pawn on a5, dark-squared bishop, and queen. Unfortunately
for him Minasian still manages to make it work as a sacrifice. And even worse
for him, one of the unwritten rules of chess strategy is that the more you try
to prevent a breakthrough, the stronger it becomes if it can be safely carried
out. --- QUESTION: Why does trying to prevent a move make it stronger? ---
ANSWER: When a breakthrough occurs the defender's pieces, that might have been
used to gain counterplay elsewhere on the board, or just left on safe squares,
find themselves part of a scattered force that invested time and energy in a
failed plan.} axb4 15. axb4 Bxb4 {EXERCISE: White is a pawn down, but how does

Black would have to recapture with the horrible 18...gxf6 to avoid losing

Rcd8 21. Bxg7 Ne5 {Now White could exchange everything off on e5 and reach an
easily winning endgame.} 22. Bh6 {QUESTION: A strong retreat?} f6 $4 {ANSWER:
No! Rather White's last move was a terrible blunder that also deserves two
question marks as it converts a winning position into a losing one. After 22...Qf6! Black would pick up the bishop on h6 due to the threat of 23...Nf3+,
winning the white queen. --- Of course, time pressure might have been a factor
here, but that is unlikely after only 22 moves, despite the difficult nature
of the game. I suspect that Nogueiras had already resigned himself to defeat,
and so wasn't looking for any incredible saving move. Meanwhile Minasian's
sense of danger deserted him as he had such a huge advantage. It only goes to
show you cannot be too careful in a winning position, and that you should
never give up hope in a losing one. --- The remainder of the game isn't
faultless, but White was always winning and eventually brought home the bacon:}

nothing if the side with the 'unprotected' bishop avoids some standard

point and facilitate the development of Black's queen's bishop? --- ANSWER:
Black's opening play has left his light squares slightly vulnerable. White is

lines. Moving the d-pawn again might seem paradoxical, but the attack on e5

think White or Black has benefited most from the breaking of symmetry in the
position after Black puts his knight on c6? --- ANSWER: It's a moot point.
Black knight is one square further up the board on c6 than it would be on d7,
and his bishop on c8 isn't blocked in so it can go quickly to e6. --- On the
other hand, White's pieces and pawns are now in greater harmony as he can use
his c-pawn to strengthen his play in the centre, whilst the black pawn on c7
is blocked in by the black knight. And as regards which knight is most
actively placed, in the long term the white horse has a post prepared for it
on c4, one rank further up the board than the knight on c6.} ({After} 8... Nbd7

etc, as in the main game.}) 9. c3 {To continue the theme of the previous note,
we might say that White's pawns are working harder than Black's. The white
pawn guards the d4-square and has the potential to support a d3-d4 advance,
whereas the black pawn on c7 can't return the compliment.} h6 10. Re1 {
QUESTION: Why does White move his rook to a blocked file? --- ANSWER: Part of
the reason for 10 Re1 is to support the e4-pawn as a prelude to a future space
gaining advance with d3-d4. However, at the moment Sepp is more concerned with
the restraint of his opponent's centre. He is keen to deter the freeing move ...d6-d5, all the more so as he intends to put his knight on c4 and doesn't want
it be attacked by the pawn advance. The placing of the rook on e1, with its
potential attack on e5 after ...d6-d5 and the reply e4xd5, serves this purpose.
--- EXERCISE: How should White respond to 10...Be6: a) With the space gaining
11 d4. --- b) With 11 Nc4 putting the knight on its best post. --- c) With the
restrained 11 b3. --- Try to assess whether the changes in pawn structures
that might arise after each move are favourable to White or Black.} b6 {A
strange decision to say the least, as with 9...h6 it seemed like Black was
preparing to put his bishop on e6 without being disturbed by Ng5.} ({ANSWER:

take on d5, White might continue to play quietly with 13 Qc2, hoping that

plan whereas White has a nice way to improve his position with a long knight
manoeuvre: Nd2, Nf1, Ne3, and Nd5.}) ({. If Black can't 'punish' 11 Nc4 then

his 'slow' moves without having to worry about a break out with ...d6-d5 as
occurs after} 11. b3 d5 {.})) 11. Nc4 Ba6 12. Qb3 {QUESTION: Why does White
put his queen on b3 rather than c2?} ({ANSWER: Perhaps he was afraid of having
his pawns doubled after} 12. Qc2 Bxc4 13. dxc4 {(wrongly in my opinion as the
exchange seems to favour White - compare the third option in the previous note)
. A good point of Qb3 is that the queen coordinates her action with the bishop
on g2 to help restrain the ...d6-d5 freeing move, all the more so now that she
can't be pinned by ...Be6. The queen and bishop would both be ready to pounce
after ...d6-d5 and the exchange e4xd5. --- As well as this preventive role for
the white queen, Sepp is using her to defend the knight as preparation for
d3-d4. If Black played passively White could continue h2-h3 (to rule out ...Ng4 after the bishop goes to e3) Be3 and Rad1, gearing up to advance in the
centre. Another way of preparing that would be Bd2, Rad1, and Bc1. This keeps
the black centre a bit more restrained than playing Be3, which blocks the
action of the rook on e1 against e5 in the event of ...d6-d5.}) 12... Nd7 {
Black decides to play his knight to c5 to harass the white queen. Removing the
horse from f6 is also the start of a very misconceived plan to advance the

moves by Black - evacuating the rook from the a8-h1 diagonal and defending the

to stop him.} 16. Na3 {The knight retreats with ideas of 17 Nb5 or possibly 17
d4, but basically White is waiting for...} f5 $2 {EXERCISE: A typical King's
Indian Defence move, but why is it positionally wrong here? --- ANSWER: There
are pawn advances that are characteristic of each structure, but they have to
be supported by the pieces. It's not good enough to reason 'It's the King's
Indian, and Fischer and Kasparov always advance ...f7-f5 when they play it, so
it can't be bad!'. --- Here the move 16...f5 is consistent with Black's play
over the last couple of moves, but it is a disastrous decision all the same.
Black clears the centre files to the benefit of the white rooks and the
embarrassment of his own queen which will be a target of the white rook on e1.
He also opens up lines on the kingside whilst three of his minor pieces are
stuck on the queenside and unable to influence matters.} 17. exf5 gxf5 {
EXERCISE: How do we refute Black's strategy? --- ANSWER:} 18. d4 $1 {This is
all the stronger for being delayed until the opponent has weakened himself. It
isn't necessary to calculate many variations, White has such an advantage in
firepower in the centre that opening lines must be good for him.} Nd7 19. Nh4 {
