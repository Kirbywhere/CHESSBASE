White is allowed to build up an earlycentral advantage but Black relies on the middlegame, hoping that the centralinstallations that White has constructed will become unwieldy and vulnerableto a devastating counterattack. In many variations, White pursues material orstrategic gains but in return Black has tactical and attacking opportunities.The King's Indian Defence appeals to players who arrive at the boardprepared for a fight.} 1.

I'd like to highlight two inparticular:} 1. Z0 (1. Z0 {Black plays for three results --- "No white playerplaying 1 d4 likes to get mated. They like long endings where they're slightlybetter, they like to attack the isolated pawn, they like to have two bishopsin the Nimzo-Indian, what they do not like is to get mated. And still, everynow and again, they do, although by now we have 100 years of experience inthis opening." - GM Rustam Kasimdzhanov. --- In his instructive series on Howto build your 1 d4 repertoire, GM Jan Gustafsson describes the King's Indianas his "personal nemesis amongst chess openings", noting that top players useit to play for a win against weaker opponents and that he has suffered moredefeats in the King's Indian than in all other openings combined. --- Ofcourse there are systems within the King's Indian where White can play withless risk (such as the Fianchetto Variation, which is dealt with in the firstpart of the book), but the fact remains that strong players can get quicklymated with White in this opening if they make a few inaccuracies. Moreover, aswe will see, Black is not merely relying on a rapid attack on the king, butcan play a more positional game, for example by exploiting the weakness of d4,or by exerting pressure on White's queenside (perhaps in combination with aBenko-style ...b7-b5 sacrifice). Overall, despite the very broad range ofsystems at White's disposal, it is quite difficult to identify a safe linewhere White plays for an edge with no risk. This alone makes the King's Indiana very attractive opening, and one which may be played in most or all of yourblack games against everything except 1 e4.}) (1. Z0 {The King's Indian isuniversal --- "The King's Indian is an opening you employ with Black against 1d4, or basically against any other move which belongs to the so-called'closed openings', so basically anything which is not 1 e4. 1 c4, 1 Nf3, 1d4, 1 g3, 1 b3, anything." - GM Rustam Kasimdzhanov --- "The main advantagefrom a black point of view is that the King's Indian you can employ againstpretty much anything and there's not much cunning White can use regarding themove order." - GM Jan Gustafsson --- "I have more frequently favoured queen'spawn openings, and have found that a healthy mix of 1 d4, 1 Nf3 and 1 c4 workswell. Many players have the basis of a decent repertoire, but have failed topay sufficient attention to the subtleties of different move orders." - GMPeter Heine Nielsen --- A trend I have noticed in my own games, and in thoseof the players I follow, is that 1 d4 players often start their games with 1Nf3 and 1 c4. This certainly seems to be the case in elite tournaments, whereWhite has struggled to demonstrate anything against the Grünfeld, and lowerrated players have copied the trend. One of the practical advantages of theKing's Indian, compared with the Grünfeld or the Nimzo-Indian, is that it isa complete system against closed openings and is not heavily dependent onWhite employing a particular move order. This cuts down on the amount ofpreparation required before a particular game - although, it must beadmitted, there's plenty to study in the King's Indian main lines in any event.Perhaps the main benefit, if a less tangible one, is that Black knows that hecan expect a similar type of position against all these first moves, and canbuild experience in these structures rather than, for example, learning abespoke line against the English which he only plays every couple of months.})*[Event "?"][Site "?"][Date "????.??.??"][Round "?"][White "A Brief Structural Overview"][Black "?"][Result "*"][ECO "E60"][Annotator "Sam Collins"][PlyCount "8"][SourceTitle "King's Indian MBM"][Source "Everyman Chess"][SourceDate "2017.07.01"]1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3.

Z0 (1. Z0 {Responsibility --- One of the bestdescriptions I've heard of the nature of the positions arising in the King'sIndian was that of my friend and coach GM Jacob Aagaard: namely that the levelof responsibility in this opening is very high. In more concrete terms, fromthe opening moves Black concedes central space and, unless he can quicklygenerate counterplay, will find himself in a prospectless position. In manylines of the Classical Variation, White is winning on the queenside, so Blackwill likely lose the game if his kingside attack fails. As we will see, Blackoften sacrifices material for positional gains or to seize the initiative, andsuch sacrifices also carry their own responsibilities, both in evaluating themcorrectly beforehand and in playing the position well thereafter. --- I wouldput a gloss on this point by saying that the level of responsibility is highfor both sides (as set out above, it is difficult for White to play withoutrisk in this opening). One of the unusual features of the King's Indian isthat many positions which are objectively lost for Black still retainprospects for counterplay, and White often draws or even loses such positionsin practice. One of the first examples in GM Ilya Smirin's recent book on theKing's Indian is the game between Yannick Pelletier and Andreas Skytte Hagenin Legnica 2013, where Black overcame a 200 point Elo deficit and won what was,objectively, a completely lost position against an experienced GM. I also likefollowing the games of GM Mark Hebden in this opening, who very frequentlygets half or full points from positions which are, objectively, dead.}) (1. Z0{Complexity --- The King's Indian is staggeringly complex. As you can see fromthe Bibliography, even in the last couple of years several large works havebeen published on this opening, including repertoires for both colours. GMKotronias has produced a five-volume repertoire work on the opening (the firstvolume of which is 720 pages). The opening has been played in hundreds ofthousands of games, and is a darling of correspondence players who are pushingforward theory with increasingly powerful engines. --- This touches on anotherunusual aspect of the King's Indian, namely that computers are of limitedassistance (they tend to assess most positions in the Classical Variation aswinning for White because Black's standard attack takes so many moves toexecute that the mate does not appear on the engines' horizons). Asexplained by Ilya Smirin in his wonderful book, the King's Indian "is a bigenough opening to have enough dimensions not to get boring". As withresponsibility, complexity cuts both ways, so let's get to work and bringWhite players out of their comfort zone.}) *[Event "?"][Site "?"][Date "????.??.??"][Round "?"][White "Dedication"][Black "?"][Result "*"][Annotator "Sam Collins"][PlyCount "1"][SourceTitle "King's Indian MBM"][Source "Everyman Chess"][SourceDate "2017.07.01"]{I'm not normally in the habit of dedicating my chess books.

Most King's Indian books start withBlack's knockout attacks in the main lines of the Classical Variation, andwe'll get to those shortly. However, in my experience, the Fianchetto is thetoughest challenge for a KID player to face. White doesn't aim for much, butcompletely changes the character of the play. Instead of being able to executethe standard plans, Black has a wide choice of lines where White runs littlerisk. --- At the start of 2015 I lost four consecutive games in the FianchettoVariation, against two IMs and two GMs. The fact that my positions in theearly phases of these games were perfectly playable, and that during the sameperiod I had convincingly beaten an experienced GM by 2½/3 in a trainingmatch on the same territory, meant little by comparison and my enthusiasm forthe King's Indian waned, driving me to other openings. One of my aims in thisbook is to rekindle my own appetite for the King's Indian, and a big part ofthat is developing a good weapon against this line. --- Black has a very widerange of options in the Fianchetto Variation (and I've tried almost all ofthem), from going into English/Benoni/Benko territory with an early ...c7-c5,to a dynamic Grünfeld with ...d7-d5, to a symmetrical Grünfeld with ...c7-c6and ...d7-d5. The pure King's Indian responses are based around an early ...d7-d6, but even here Black has a wide choice, principally between theclassical ...Nbd7 (aiming for ...e7-e5) and the more modern ...Nc6 (which canbe combined with various plans, including queenside expansion with ...a7-a6, ...Rb8 and ...b7-b5). --- My selected line for this book is a relatively recenttrend, based on putting the knight on c6 and pushing ...e7-e5, which hasshown up repeatedly in games of strong KID experts like GMs Arkady Naiditsch,Alexander Onischuk, and Sébastian Mazé. Black obtains a similar set-up tosome lines of the Classical Variation (in particular, the Petrosian Variation)and, in my view, the means of counterplay are quite typical for the KID (oftenbased on ...f7-f5) and so should be relatively easy to play.} *[Event "1.

Lemosdoesn't deal with the move either. --- QUESTION: But Black has lost two wholetempi! --- ANSWER: It's true that Black has invested two moves in thisoperation, by bringing his knight to c6 and returning home; but in order togain time, White has defined the central structure by pushing d4-d5. This isby no means a bad move, gaining central space, but it means that play will bedirected to the wings: White will tend to play on the queenside, and Blackwill counterattack on the kingside. And this is where the attraction of thisline lies for Black. --- A number of other systems against the FianchettoVariation offer Black prospects of counterplay while running some strategicrisk; for example: --- 1. The classic ...Nbd7, ...e7-e5 and ...e5xd4 lines,as featured in the stunning classic wins by Bronstein against Zita (Moscow1946) and Reshevsky (Zurich 1953) - if you haven't seen these games, put thisbook down and look them up immediately! --- 2. The Panno System - with themove order in this game, continue 7...a6 8 d5 (of course there arealternatives) 8...Na5 9 Nd2 c5. Black will follow up with ...Rb8 and ...b7-b5and try to create queenside counterplay. --- 3. The Gallagher Variation, basedon ...Nbd7, ...e7-e5, ...e5xd4 and ...a7-a6 when, having placed his rooks one8 and b8, Black can create chaos with ...c7-c5 and ...b7-b5, oftensacrificing his d6-pawn in the process. --- While these systems are allplayable, for the most part they aim for counterplay in the centre or on thequeenside. The traditional kingside pawn storm, which Black so enjoys in theClassical Variation, was believed simply not to work against the Fianchetto.This 8...Nb8 variation is the only line where I have seen these kingside pawnstorms being launched (and landing!) on a regular basis. --- I might also notethat this concept of losing time with the knight to provoke d4-d5 is knownfrom other openings, such as the Classical Pirc: 1 e4 d6 2 d4 Nf6 3 Nc3 g6 4Nf3 Bg7 5 Be2 0-0 6 0-0 Nc6 7 d5 Nb8 (a favourite of Mamedyarov, which he'sused to great effect in blitz games but also in important events like theWorld Cup).} ({The traditional move here was} 8...

I was lucky toscore one draw from these two games. --- The problem for the defender is thatit's really hard to force the trade of rooks and, because of theopposite-coloured bishops, king safety can be an issue even in verysimplified positions (since you can't compete on the squares controlled bythe enemy bishop).

Many theoreticalsources dismiss this line as equal (as with comparable exchange variations inthe Classical King's Indian, the Slav or the French). However, it is preciselythese lines where I think detailed preparation is required by Black, for anumber of reasons: --- 1. White, having an extra move, retains some initiativein exchange variations, even when the structure is symmetrical and/or theposition is heavily simplified. This initiative needs to be carefullyextinguished before it results in something tangible. --- 2. Many playersautomatically relax with Black in symmetrical or simplified positions, orpositions which are assessed as equal, sometimes assuming that their opponentsare playing for a draw. This results in diminished vigilance and careless play,which can get you into real trouble. --- 3. The character of the play inexchange variations is often quite different from the main lines. CertainlyWhite is running less risk here and a direct attack on her king will be veryrare. Therefore this type of position is often unwelcome to a King's Indianplayer, who is seeking more exciting and unbalanced play.} dxe5 {Both thismove and 8...Nxe5 have their supporters. In general, trading a pair ofknights simplifies the position, which should increase the drawing margin forboth players. It also enables Black to play ...c7-c6, which is an effectiveway of fighting for the important d5-square and seeking to limit the activityof the bishop on g2. In the end I decided to concentrate on 8...dxe5, since itis the choice of such experts as Naiditsch and Bacrot, whose openingselections are worth considering carefully.} 9.

This would significantly improve herposition, since the knight on b6 would control d5 and attack c4, while gainingtime on the queen on a4.

QUESTION: White has closed the centre. What changes does this make to bothsides' plans? --- ANSWER: With a closed centre, play typically migrates to theflanks. I think there are two reasons for this. Firstly (and most simply),there are no central pawn breaks available anymore, and putting the rooks onthe d- and e-files isn't effective for either side. Secondly, play on theflank cannot be effectively met by a strike in the centre. With his pawn stillon d4, White would need to think twice before pushing his a-, b- and c-pawns,since the g7-bishop would exert unpleasant pressure on the queenside, andBlack could seek to arrange central counterplay, possibly with ...c7-c6 and ...d6-d5. Similarly, with White's pawn still on d4, if Black pushed his f-, g-and h-pawns up the board, he would risk being with left with weaknesses orbeing overrun in the centre (with d4xe5, or perhaps c4-c5 to soften up thecentral structure) and would expose his king; for example, unpleasant threatsmight be created on the a2-g8 or a1-h8 diagonals. --- In the current structure,it's very attractive for White to play on the queenside and, in particular, toachieve the c4-c5 break. He has far more space there (in particular, his c-and d-pawns are more advanced than their counterparts), while Black has fewdefenders but many potential targets. For example, if White penetrates to c7with a rook or a knight, Black's position could become critical. Blacktherefore needs to find counterplay, and the most reliable way of doing so isto aggressively play on the kingside (and against the white king) with ...f7-f5 followed, in some cases, by a massive kingside pawn storm. This is oneof the few openings where this is a good plan for Black, and one of the onlyopenings after 1 d4 where White can get checkmated without making an obviousblunder. Therein lies the attraction of the King's Indian from Black'sperspective. Nevertheless, White's queenside plan is extremely dangerous andBlack needs to play precisely here. --- White has three main options at movenine. Two are directed against ...Nh5, while rerouting the knight to thequeenside (9 Ne1 and 9 Nd2). The third, the so-called "Bayonet Attack" with 9b4, is a more modern approach which was popularized by Kramnik and, accordingto legend, is the reason Kasparov stopped playing the King's Indian towardsthe end of his career.} *[Event "5.

White also gains more flexibility with his kingsidestructure: in particular, he can play f2-f3 (supporting his e4-pawn, andcreating a square on f2 for a bishop or a knight) and even, in some variations,g2-g4 (an apparently outlandish move, but one which aims to avoid the typicalsuffocating KID attack by giving more space to the white king and hisdefenders).} ({The alternative retreat,} 9. Nd2 {, is examined in Game 12.}) ({The line I've chosen against} 9. b4 {generally transposes, so is covered thereas well.}) 9...

Be3 {QUESTION:Surely this is asking for it? Black aims for a kingside pawn storm and Whiteinvites it with tempo? --- ANSWER: 10 Be3 does indeed lose time to theforthcoming ...f5-f4, and so this line is the most critical in the wholeKing's Indian. It's also the line where White is most likely to get checkmatedby move 30. However, the bishop (which will soon drop back to f2) has both adefensive function (covering important squares on g3 and h4, although againthis can encourage a ...g4-g3 sacrifice by Black) and a very importantattacking function (aiming at key queenside dark squares and, in particular,a7).

Rather than giving up a pawn with 14 c5,White supports the c4-c5 break and creates the immediate threat of Nxa7 (whichis unfortunate) followed by Nxc8 (which is absolutely fatal). Although we willtouch on this theme several times in this book, now is a good time for a popquiz: --- QUESTION: Which is Black's most important piece in the King's Indian,in particular when he launches a kingside pawn storm? --- ANSWER: Somewhatcounterintuitively, the answer is the c8-bishop. This piece (which isundeveloped and currently has no legal moves) has two vital functions: --- Thefirst is supporting the ...g5-g4 break, without which Black doesn't have anyreal attack. --- The second looks like a tactical fluke, but is actually a keystrategic theme: once Black plays ...g4-g3, if this is met by h2-h3, then ...Bxh3!! is the key sacrifice without which the King's Indian, in its modernform, would simply not be playable, since the white king would sit safelybehind a completely blocked pawn chain. Once ...Bxh3 lands, in very manypositions White is completely lost. You'll need to see a few examples of thistheme (and there are several in this book) to believe it, but for now justtake my word for it - in the King's Indian generally, and the Mar del Plataline in particular, Black cannot allow his light-squared bishop to beexchanged. --- EXERCISE: White has an immediate threat of Nxa7.

I can't emphasize enough thatpositions of this type, where Black is collapsing on the queenside but has afar advanced kingside pawn storm, are almost always unplayable without thelight-squared bishop, and taking a knight on e6 (even winning a pawn in theprocess) isn't a good enough outcome for this piece.}) 20. hxg3 ({Not} 20. Bxa7$2 Qxa5 $1 {and Black wins material.}) 20... fxg3 21. Bxg3 {QUESTION: What hasBlack obtained for his pawn sacrifice? --- ANSWER: Several things: -- 1. Blacknow has two half-open files (g- and f-) towards the white king. In particular,the g-file will be a very promising avenue for a rook (on g7) and perhaps thequeen (on g5). -- 2. Black has obtained possibilities of using severalexcellent squares close to the white king. The c1-h6 diagonal has opened, andcan be occupied by Black's dark-squared bishop. The squares on g3 and f4 canbe occupied by the black knights (after ...h5-h4 and ...Nh5). -- 3. Blackobtains a potential pawn break, namely ...h5-h4-h3, to weaken White'sstructure further. -- 4. White's kingside structure has been weakened by theremoval of the h2-pawn. Note that a standard sequence of ...g5-g4-g3xh2 canoften be met by Kh1!, sheltering behind the black pawn which can block its ownforces. Here the white king is more open. -- 5. Finally, Black gains some timeand initiative. The white bishop has been deflected from its attacking dutieson the queenside (from f2 it targeted a7, which couldn't easily be dealt with),and is exposed to further attack (after ...h5-h4 or ...Rg7, it will likelyhave to move again). --- Against this, White has some reasons to be happy too.He is now a pawn up, and often relies on this by returning it with f3-f4 (which gives his pieces more space to operate on the kingside and can dampenBlack's attack there). In addition, White now knows the type of game Black isplaying. With the pawn on g4, Black threatens a gradual protected push to g3 (say after ...Bh6, ...Rg7 and, perhaps, moving the knight from g6) when thepawn controls key squares immediately around the white king, and h2-h3 canoften be met by the key ...Bxh3! sacrifice. By committing to the pawnsacrifice, Black loses some flexibility in his attack.} Bh6 {I like this move;Black activates his "problem" dark-squared bishop with tempo and vacates theg7-square for the rook.} ({Alternatively,} 21... h4 {has been tried byCheparinov; for example:} 22.

The general idea behind g2-g4 in the Classical is to gain more space soas to make it easier to defend the king. A related and very important idea isthat, if the kingside becomes blocked, Black will have no counterplay andWhite will simply win the game on the queenside.} Nf6 ({Another option is} 11...

He will continue with ...Rf7 and ...Raf8, followedby ...h6-h5, after which he can activate his dark-squared bishop by ...Bh6 orexamine breakthroughs on the kingside with ...h5-h4. The white knight on e4 iswell placed but is also a tactical weakness since it can't easily be supportedby a pawn; f2-f3 would open lines in Black's favour and, in many cases, dropthe g3-pawn. --- The assessment is informed, in part, by the present game,where White (a very strong GM) loses largely without a fight.} 20.

Ofthese, in my view the line where White runs the most strategic risk (especially if he plays passively) is against the King's Indian. This isbecause Black can use the outpost on d4, whereas the d5-square can, in thelong run, be covered by ...c7-c6. If this were the only factor in the position,White would be worse, but of course, the story is more complicated.

Be3 {QUESTION: How would you assess this position? ---ANSWER: To my mind, it's a good example of how static factors can lead to amisassessment of various King's Indian positions. It's tempting, for instance,to say that the g7-bishop is "bad" (versus the "good" bishop on e3), and thata white knight on d5 would be difficult to challenge, whereas a black knighton d4 could be captured by White's bishop. --- However, the dynamics of theposition are strongly in Black's favour. He's ready to occupy the d4-squarewith his knight (while White is several moves away from an invasion of d5),and taking this piece would leave Black with a dangerous passed pawn and adominant dark-squared bishop. The black rooks also find work more easily thantheir white counterparts. Finally, Black has the only active pawn break in theposition, namely ...f7-f5 (whereas f2-f4 by White would weaken the longdiagonal and the e4-pawn). --- There's little doubt but that Mirzoev (a2525-rated GM) picked this as a "safe" line, but he rapidly finds himself in aprospectless position.

As well as being extremely strong (normally rated over 2700), Bacrotplays in quite a lot of mixed strength events (opens and team competitions),where he needs to be able to play for a win as Black. While he has a broadrepertoire and can handle many positions well (being extremely solid on theblack side of the Queen's Gambit Declined, for instance), for such a playerit's extremely useful to have an opening like the King's Indian in his arsenal.I was playing in the same tournament as Bacrot at the time of the present game,though I don't recall seeing it live. I was, and remain, deeply impressed atBacrot's ability to win convincingly with Black against a strong Georgian GM,resulting in a precious point for France in one of their most successfulOlympiads ever (France were competing for medals until the very last rounds),under the wonderful captaincy of my friend and Gonzaga Chess colleague (andKing's Indian expert), GM Sébastian Mazé.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 ({You might have noticed} 3. f3 {cropping up in elite tournaments. --- QUESTION:Why does White play this? And does it simply result in a transposition to themain lines of the Sämisch? --- ANSWER: 3 f3 is primarily directed againstGrünfeld players. While Black can (and often does) play 3...d5 here, after 4cxd5 Nxd5 5 e4, the black knight is forced to retreat since there's no knighton c3 to exchange. This is hardly a disaster for Black, who continues with 5...Nb6, but the resulting positions are generally believed to offer some chancesto White, against an opening where top players often struggle to demonstrateanything convincing. --- The unnatural-looking 3 f3 permits a range ofacceptable responses, such as 3...c5 (aiming for Benoni-type structures after4 d5) or even the odd-looking 3...e6 (when play often goes into Queen's Indian/Nimzo-Indian/Queen's Gambit Declined channels where, Black hopes, the f2-f3move is more out of place than ...g7-g6). However, for King's Indian players,the most natural and consistent response is} Bg7 {. Then after} 4. e4 d6 {, White can transpose directly to the Sämisch with 5 Nc3, but he can also bemore sophisticated and opt for} 5. Ne2 {. --- EXERCISE: Why would White playthis? (Hint: Try to work out how White will develop his pieces, especially hisknights - it's not so easy!) --- ANSWER: In the Sämisch, White struggles tofind a good square for his g1-knight. Indeed, the famous King's Indianaficionado, GM Gufeld, suggested that, in the Sämisch, we should ask theg1-knight what he thinks about the move f2-f3! Clearly this move takes awaythe knight's most natural developing square, leaving two remaining candidates,each with their pros and cons: -- a) The knight could go to h3. While thislooks like a poor move, the knight is aiming for f2, which is actually notsuch a bad square in this structure. The main problem with Nh3 is that Whiteneeds to wait for ...Nbd7 first, since otherwise Black will happily play ...Bxh3, spoiling White's structure. -- b) The knight could go to e2. This issensible, but creates another problem - what about the bishop on f1? Thebishop rarely goes to d3 in these lines since, as we will see, Black tends togenerate quick pressure on the d4-pawn, and White doesn't want to interferewith his queen's defence of this pawn. The bishop would like to go to e2, butof course both white pieces can't occupy the same square. And if the knightgoes to e2 while the bishop is on f1, then it will need to move again in orderto allow the bishop out and White to castle kingside. --- The knight on e2 hasa limited number of squares to go to, each with their problems: on g3, it canbe quickly harassed with ...h7-h5-h4, gaining space and kingside counterplay;on f4, the knight is slightly awkward, and sets up possibilities of ...e7-e5 (perhaps with a sacrifice on d4), forking d4 and f4; on c1, it is ratherpassive, and interferes with the development of White's queenside. In fact,the perfect square for a knight on e2 is c3, where it is active, has strongcentral influence, and doesn't interfere with White's other pieces. Theproblem is that White's other knight tends to be on c3 (from as early as thethird move in the Sämisch). --- And now, finally, we can see White's idea. Bysending his g1-knight, via e2, to c3, he prepares the rapid development of hiskingside, avoiding the problems outlined above. His queen's knight, meanwhile,can develop to d2 (once the c1-bishop is brought out to e3 or g5). So White isaiming for a set-up which, he argues, is more harmonious than he wouldnormally obtain from a standard Sämisch set-up. --- In response we'll proceedwith the same plan of ...c7-c5 as in the main line; i.e.} O-O 6.

What, if any, compensation does he have in this position? --- ANSWER:Black's compensation can be described in a few ways: -- 1) He has a big leadin development - he has developed three minor pieces to White's two, castled,and brought his rook to d8. In addition, the bishop on c5 is likely to costWhite a further tempo, after ...Nd7 or ...b7-b6. As we will see, it takesWhite a really long time to mobilize his kingside pieces in this line. -- 2)White's dark squares are chronically weak. The black pieces already haveexcellent control of the d4-square (and the whole a1-h8 diagonal), whileadditional jumping points for the knights include e5 (with ...Nd7-e5) or evenb4 (after ...a7-a5 and ...Nb4).

Everyone knows that opposite-coloured bishopscan exert strong drawing tendencies, offering drawing chances even severalpawns down in "pure" opposite-coloured bishop endgames. With other pieces onthe board, however, the inferior side can really suffer. Here, with rooks onthe board, White can never neutralize the d3-pawn, and is subject to along-term attack on the light-squares. --- The above analysis would hold trueeven after a lazy, automatic move like 24...Rac8?.

There are two aspects to this: --- 1. White has theoption of playing g2-g4. While this doesn't strictly prevent ...f7-f5, whichwould be supported three times (by the g6-pawn, the c8-bishop, and the f8-rook), Black would need to take into account two new positional features: (i) apossible attack on the g-file (if Black responds to g4xf5 by capturing withthe g-pawn); or (ii) White gaining control of the e4-square (if Blackrecaptures on f5 with a piece). --- 2. White can also play more subtly torender ...f7-f5 less desirable or more difficult to achieve. One idea is tomeet ...Nh5 with Nh2, when after ...f7-f5 and e4xf5 Black can't comfortablyrecapture, since ...g6xf5 would hang the h5-knight to the queen on d1, while ...Bxf5 or ...Rxf5 would run into g2-g4, again winning a piece. --- QUESTION:Sounds good. What are the downsides to 6 h3 - ? --- ANSWER: Firstly, White'sking safety tends to be an issue in these lines. He is unlikely to find a safehaven on the kingside, especially if he plays g2-g4. Keeping his king in thecentre or castling queenside will also give Black his fair share of attackingchances. Secondly, White is spending time which Black can use to acceleratehis own counterplay. If Black achieves ...f7-f5 under favourable conditions,White's set-up will start looking shaky. --- We should also note that play byWhite on the queenside is more problematic in these lines than in theClassical systems, due either to king safety or a lack of development (the twodetails discussed above). Black can often get a knight to c5 and eithersupport it with ...a7-a5, or exploit the loosening of White's queensidestructure after b2-b4. --- Generally speaking, the positions tend to be freshand very double edged, which means that King's Indian players should welcomeh2-h3, in my opinion. --- There is considerable debate over the move orderhere, so I'll spend some time describing why I chose the recommended path.} Nh5{Playing for an immediate ...f7-f5 looks like the most logical plan.} ({Kotronias recommends} 7... a5 {in his King's Indian repertoire series. It's areasonable move, preparing ...Na6-c5. However, Robin Van Kampen makes acompelling case for omitting or delaying ...a7-a5, since meeting ...Na6-c5with b2-b4 can be very double edged, especially if the position opens. Moreconcretely, I don't like giving White the option of} 8. g4 {, preventing ...Nh5.}) 8. g3 {White's most popular move, controlling the f4-square.} (8. Nh2 {is a serious alternative (see the notes to Game 23).}) ({Of course} 8. g4 {would be happily met by} Nf4 {. Even if White wins a pawn after} 9.

This move was endorsed by one of the top KID experts, eliteChinese GM Ding Liren: "I have had this position with both sides and come tothe conclusion that maybe the plan of 7...Nh5 followed by ...f5 suited thespirit of the position most." --- The big downside of this move is that Whitegets a couple of very dangerous options after} 9. exf5 gxf5 {, in particular}10. Ng5 ({and} 10. Nh4 {, which have been tried in top-level games, includingsome by Tomashevsky. These are huge lines to prepare for Black and it makesmore sense to simply avoid them. White gains some additional options (comparedto 8...f5) after 8...Na6 too, but these seem less threatening to me, even inthe simple sense of not involving an enemy knight moving towards the weakenedblack kingside.

The present version shows, in apure and uncomplicated form, an idea which, I think, Ding Liren believes aboutthe King's Indian, namely that having an unopposed dark-squared bishop on anopen diagonal is worth a pawn. Many of his games feature sacrifices to open upthis bishop, including pawn and exchange sacrifices. What is worth noting ishow calmly he continues to develop, being confident that he has fullpositional compensation for the pawn. --- R.Ponomariov-Ding Liren, Danzhou2014, continued} Nd7 14.
