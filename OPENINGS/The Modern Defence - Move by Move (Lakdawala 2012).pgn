{This new series provides an ideal platform to study chess openings. By
continually challenging the reader to answer probing questions throughout the
book, the 'Move by Move' format greatly encourages the learning and practising
of vital skills just as much as the traditional assimilation of opening
knowledge. Carefully selected questions and answers are designed to keep you
actively involved and allow you to monitor your progress as you learn. This is
an excellent way to study any chess opening and at the same time improve your
general chess skills and knowledge. --- The Modern Defence is an ambitious,
counter-attacking choice for Black which can be played against all mainline
openings. In typical hypermodern style, Black allows White to occupy the
centre and then undermines this centre by attacking it with pawns and pieces.
In this book, Cyrus Lakdawala examines the key variations of the Modern
Defence. He shares his experience and knowledge, presents a repertoire for
Black and provides answers to all the key questions.} 1. -- {Cyrus Lakdawala

{'Move by Move' is a series of opening books which uses a question-and-answer
format. One of our main aims of the series is to replicate - as much as
possible - lessons between chess teachers and students. --- All the way
through, readers will be challenged to answer searching questions and to
complete exercises, to test their skills in chess openings and indeed in other
key aspects of the game. It's our firm belief that practising your skills like
this is an excellent way to study chess openings, and to study chess in
general. --- Many thanks go to all those who have been kind enough to offer
inspiration, advice and assistance in the creation of 'Move by Move'. We're
really excited by this series and hope that readers will share our enthusiasm.

{I recall a game I played during a lunch break in seventh grade against one of
the history teachers. He opened with} 1. e4 {. At the time I read 'Canadian
Chess Chat' magazine, which was permeated with the games of Canada's chess god,
Duncan Suttles, who opened} g6 $1 {on every white first move. --- Now from my
rudimentary understanding, I reasoned that there was no higher chess authority
than Suttles, so like a faithful acolyte I dutifully followed suit and played
1...g6!. The history teacher closed his eyes and nodded wisely, as if
confirming some long-held suspicion about my intelligence level. Then he
issued this ominous prediction: "You have just lost the game!" "Why!?" I
whined vehemently. The wise teacher went on to explain: "Both players should
fight for the centre of the board, therefore 1...g6 is a weak move which hands
White central control." --- Even then, intuition warned me that something was
off with the teacher's bogus assessment. Forty years later, I confidently
assert that the teacher was wrong, and the Modern Defence is sound, and the
stats are there to prove it. Luckily, I didn't believe him and play the Modern
to this day.} 2. -- {The Modern is indeed a scary, counter-intuitive opening
and the rules which govern are quite distinct from those in other, more
orthodox openings. We Modernists view life on the chess board with
extraterrestrial, alien perception. After all, as the teacher pointed out,
Black, in hypermodern fashion, cedes White central control without a fight.
But giving away the centre is not done with a motivation of generosity or
trepidation. The plan is to later chip away at White's centre from the sides
and tear it down. --- The second scary issue people have with the Modern (as
John Watson once pointed out) is the fact that many of the lines look similar,
except for some minute, imperceptible shift, and that one tiny shift may
completely alter your strategy from the other look-alike variation. The
structure alters in astonishingly disorienting ways, like some alien shape
shifter, who appears differently each day. Both we and our opponents walk
theoretical corridors on unsteady legs, but this is not such a big problem if
you think about it. --- Have you ever eaten a curry so hot that there actually
is no taste except for the all-encompassing bonfire in your mouth (I am Indian
and have endured this experience many, many times)? The Modern is a bit like
this: it is so complicated that it is easy to play! If chaos and complexity
increase past the limits of the understanding of most club players - or even
GMs for that matter - the participants basically tend to play by feel. This in
turn means that the Modern player is accustomed to such chaos, while White
encounters it rarely and is often left groping about for the right plan. ---
If you just go through the games of this book and study the great Modernists
and post-Modernists, like: Duncan Suttles, Ray Keene, Jon Speelman, Nigel
Davies, Colin McNab, Tiger Hillarp Person, Zurab Azmaiparashvili and Peter
Svidler, I bet you will not be overwhelmed and boggled by the complexity,
unlike many of your unfortunate opponents, who don't encounter the Modern all
that often.} (2. -- {The Mechanics of the Modern Defence: -- Unlike classical,
solid opening lines like 1 e4 e5, the Caro-Kann, or the Queen's Gambit
Declined, the Modern doesn't fight for central control, or solidity, or even
seek to equalize. We begin asymmetrically and challenge White from our very
first move. For years I endured from lower-rated players playing White, the
Exchange Slav and the Exchange French, both with the intent to take the life
out of positions, and allow my lower-rated opponents to deaden the position
and draw. --- A few years back I got tired of this weasely strategy from my
more cowardly opponents and added my childhood favourite 1...g6 against any
first move. I noticed with shock that after a year my stats were actually
equal to or better than with the Slav, the Caro-Kann, the French and the
Sicilian. The number of draws went way down, and my losses in turn thankfully
did not increase (too much at least!). I am normally associated with
super-solid lines like the Slav and Caro, but now add 1...g6 (and the Modern's
introverted brother 1...d6) as one of my main openings as Black.}) (2. -- {
1...g6 Against Everything! -- The Modern represents a one-size-fits-all line.
We play it against virtually every (well, okay, maybe not against 1 b3!) main
white first move choice: 1 e4, 1 d4, 1 c4, and 1 Nf3. --- Here is an old
school Modern, one of my all time favourites (see Janosevic-Suttles).}) (2. --

1. e4 g6 {Enter the rabbit hole, my friend. I still remember the initial shock
I received when first going over the game in 1969; a mind-altering experience.}
2. d4 Bg7 3. Nf3 d6 4. Nc3 c6 ({Back in the old days we all played ...c6
Moderns since it never occurred to us to play} 4... a6 $1 {. --- QUESTION:
What are the differences between ...c6 and ...a6? --- ANSWER: I think 4...a6!
is an improvement for this reason: in the ...c6 lines Black often plays ...b5,
...a6, ...Bb7, and ...c5 later on. Well, in the ...a6! lines we cut out the
single redundancy of the ...c6 middle man, and gain a tempo by simply
eliminating an often unnecessary move.}) 5. Be2 Nd7 6. O-O Nh6 $5 {Hallucinogens are optional. As always, Suttles imposes his anarchistic Suttleszian world
view upon the board. You must keep in context that in 1969 Yoko hadn't yet
messed everything up with The Beatles. We all dressed outlandishly, all the
while thinking aberrant, odd thoughts and doing groovy, psychedelic,
perplexing things! --- QUESTION: Black's move has to be bad, right? --- ANSWER:
Good and bad, virtue and sin go out the window in these 60's Modern
dreamscapes. Black's eccentric last move keeps open possibilities of ...f6 and
...Nf7 or even ...f5.} ({Normal would be something like} 6... Qc7 7. a4 Ngf6 8.
h3 O-O {, V.Topalov-R.Rauschenbach, Frankfurt (rapid) 1997, but Suttles never
ever played Moderns like this one.}) 7. Bg5 {Provoking ...f6. The trouble is

Qd5+ Nf7 14. Qxc6 Bd7 {, but those two open files should give Black some Benko
Gambit-style compensation.}) 10... Bxd4 $5 {QUESTION: What the hell!? ---
ANSWER: No, this isn't a dream, or a move played on the theory that a few
bitter greens enhance the salad. We are reminded of the lyrics of the Gordon
Lightfoot song: "Carefree Highway, let me slip away, slip away on you." Are
you confused yet? I'm not sure if this move deserves a '??' or a '!!', so I
hedged my bets and gave it one of each. Who knows if Suttles' win was the
result of a mindbendingly deep strategic plan, or simply an accident of grace
which fell before his feet. --- I realize Black's last move looks as out of
place as Hulk Hogan at the library. It certainly feels like Black pushes his
position far past tolerable limits of endurance by casually handing over his
monster dark-squared bishop for no visible compensation, the original sin in
the Modern. Keep in mind, though, every religion cherishes its dogmas, which
unbelievers like Suttles reject. In this case Black does indeed accrue a
subtle gain in exchange for the trade: he takes control over e5.} ({

was probably nervous about Black's initiative after} Nf7 14. Qxc6 Rb8 15. Bc1 {

gets all sorts of practical chances after the sac: -- 1. He owns the e5-square.
-- 2. Tricks with ...f3 are in the air. -- 3. He may get Benko Gambit-like
pressure down the queenside files.}) 13... Nf7 14. Bxf4 $2 {"White has been

1. e4 g6 2. d4 Bg7 3. Nc3 d6 4. Be3 a6 5. Qd2 Nd7 6. f3 {. Some players are so
loyal to their ideals that they can never be bought off or negotiated away
from their core beliefs. In this case, your opponent is likely a pure attacker
who believes Black has committed the original sin of falling behind in
development without culpability, and White feels he is the instrument of
divine punishment to come. However, matters are not so simple. We, on the
other hand, refuse to make eye contact with White, frustrating attempts to
open the position at every turn. I actually believe we enter a favourable
version of a Sicilian Dragon. Why favourable? --- There are two critical
differences; I believe both to be in Black's favour: -- 1. Black's king,
unlike in most Dragons, remains uncommitted. White has trouble hunting down a
moving target. Black can castle queenside, keep his king in the middle, or
castle kingside later on. -- 2. Black's pawns are rather fixed and rigid in
most Dragons. In the Modern, the opposite is the case. White may attack the
same way as in a Dragon, with f3, g4, h4, but Black has access to a million
shifts in structure. For example, he can play his pawn to h6, to h5, or leave
it alone on h7. Black may develop his knight to f6, but can also play ...e6
(or ...e5), and ...Ne7, or even ...Nh6 in some cases. In essence Black's
structure remains a lot shiftier in the Modern.} -- {In a sense, the first two
chapters are the most important of the king's pawn section of the book since
they are so common. I arrive at positions from Chapters One and Two in about
60% of my Modern games, so study them well and be familiar with Black's plans
and ideas.} *

Instead} 4... Nf6 {would be our goody-two-shoes cousin, the Pirc. --- QUESTION:
How do the Modern and Pirc differ? --- ANSWER: In the Pirc, Black plays a very
early ...Nf6, which usually induces Nc3 from White. This means Pircs tend to
be king's pawn games. Black in the Modern, on the other hand, delays the
development of the g8-knight. This means White has the option of entering e4,
d4, c4 King's Indian Defence-like structures, which we examine later in the
book. Also, by avoiding an early ...Nf6, we take most of the sting out of
White's dreaded e5 thrust, which can be so painful for those poor, misguided
Pirc folk out there. The Modern pawn structure tends to be a lot more fluid
and I believe the positions flow toward the abstract more than the
straightforward ones reached from Pirc.}) 5. Qd2 ({
QUESTION: What do we do if White plays} 5. f4 {here? --- ANSWER: Please see
Chapter Three on the Austrian Attack! It's just a transposition.}) 5... Nd7 {
QUESTION: What is Black's plan? --- ANSWER: Generally, Black strives for a
delayed, and possibly favourable Sicilian Dragon, with a hint of Sicilian
Najdorf - perhaps more a Dragodorf - by continuing with ...Bb7, ...Rc8, and ...c5.} 6. f3 {QUESTION: What is the point of playing 6 f3? --- ANSWER: Defence
of the e-pawn is one of White's biggest headaches in the ...a6 Modern lines.
By reinforcing e4, White simply frees himself from this worry. White also
invariably plans a pawn storm, with h4-h5 and going bonkers on the kingside.
As we will learn, the only problem with White's plan is that nobody told him
Black's king doesn't make his home on the kingside yet! So sometimes we get
the effect of a heavily-armed swat team raiding an empty home. The down side
to 6 f3 is that it isn't a developing move and blocks f3, the natural square
for the g1-knight. This in turn tends to clog White's development.} ({

1. e4 g6 2. d4 Bg7 3. Nc3 d6 4. Be3 a6 5. Qd2 Nd7 6. f3 ({The immediate} 6. h4
{can also be played.}) ({QUESTION: Can White mix a4 and f3 in such positions?
--- ANSWER: This rare plan is playable, but strikes me as somewhat illogical
since White, having played a4, is pretty much committed to kingside castling.
So in essence, it knocks out one of his main options. An example:} 6. a4 b6 7.
f3 e6 $1 {(normally I only enter the Hippopotamus if White's knight has
already committed to f3; this is the rare exception to the rule)} 8. h4 h5 9.

computers say equal, but I doubt their word. Black's control over the central
dark squares gives him the edge. Also, I don't see a good plan for White.})

preference in such positions. Black plans to meet h5 with the bypass move ...g5.}) 8. g4 h6 $5 {QUESTION: How will Black ever castle now? --- ANSWER: Maybe
he never will, or he may go the other direction. Remember, things change. He
may castle kingside ten moves (or 20 or 30!) from now when White's guns aren't
quite so trained upon his kingside. I realize Black's last move has the
appearance of straining against the conventional letter of the law: don't
weaken pawns on the side you are likely to castle. Yet in an odd way the move
remains faithful to the spirit of the position: don't give your opponent an
easy target for confrontation.} 9. Nh3 Nb6 $1 {QUESTION: What is Black's idea?
--- ANSWER: Multipurpose: -- 1. If White ever plays e5, then Black retains a
firm grip on the d5-square. -- 2. Black may later play ...b4, forcing White's
knight to b1. If Ne2, then Black can play ...Nc4!, swapping off White's
powerful dark-squared bishop. -- 3. White must watch out for both ...Nc4 and ...Na4 if she castles queenside. -- 4. Black makes room for a future ...Nfd7 and
c5, which begins an attack and increases the scope of the g7-bishop.} 10. O-O-O

sleeping knight on b1. Even here, I don't like White's game since it's hard to
find a line-opening target. Black, on the other hand, has access to a clear
target: White's king.}) 13... Bb7 14. d5 {White inhibits Black's c-pawn.} c5 $3

assesses as slightly in Black's favour.}) 15... Bxc6 $1 {
Svidler's clever point.} 16. Qe2 {
QUESTION: Am I awake or dreaming? Why didn't White take on c6?} ({ANSWER: When
you see a super GM hang a piece and it looks too good to be true, it probably
qualifies as just that!} 16. Bxc6 $4 {is met with the crushing} Nc4 $1 {
when the knight claps his hands to get White's attention. Now we begin to see
some of the nasty offshoots behind 9...Nb6.}) 16... Rc8 17. Bxc6 Rxc6 {

up some dust and trouble around Black's king.} Qxf4 $1 {Svidler displays
masterful control with this confident response. Black's king finds himself
stripped of most of his pawn cover, yet Svidler, in comp-like fashion, works
out a defensive/offensive algorithm for every eventuality.} 33. Qxg6+ Kh8 34.

force: Black's works; White's doesn't. How would you play for Black? ---} {
ANSWER: Play on White's weak back rank.} Rh2 $1 {. Black's rook expels the
intruding h1-rook the way a violent cough discharges phlegm from the lungs.} ({

once so unassuming and demure, now takes matters into her own hands by
bottling White's temporary initiative and sealing the lid tightly. --- SUMMARY:

in the Modern: our hyper-flexible pawn structure. Now White saw nothing better

Black plays the same plan.} 12. exd5 $6 {White wants access to e4, and is

QUESTION: Well then, what would you suggest for White? --- ANSWER: I would go

French or Advance Caro-Kann structure for Black.}) 12... Nxd5 13. Nxd5 Bxd5 ({

strength isn't so much a strength as much as a function of White's weakness. I

can White do besides castling queenside? --- ANSWER: I would think about

more thought than others. I'm pleased to see that you took my theory on the
virtues of greed to heart. However, too much of anything degenerates into a
vice. I'm sure Black is winning after taking the exchange, but it would be
prudent avoid it. Doing so gives away too many dark squares, which in turn,
hands White swindling chances.} 25. Bxg6 $5 {Long-brewing resentment tends to
lead us down the path of disproportionate overreaction. The sac is technically
unsound, but White, facing an existential crisis, decides to go with the
theory: if you are busted, you may as well stir the jug, drink the poisoned
Kool-Aid and sac rather than suffer a lingering death by slow-motion decay.

behind early castling is that White refuses to play games with Black about
where his king should reside. He simply castles, increases his lead in

irrespective of where Black places his king. --- QUESTION: How do we

may be correct on paper, but he also trades one tactically vulnerable square
for his queen, only to replace it with another just as tactically vulnerable,

1. e4 g6 2. d4 Bg7 3. Nc3 d6 4. Be3 a6 5. Nf3 b5 {. Study this chapter
carefully since this is a very common set-up for White who begins exactly as
in Chapter One. However, then, sooner or later, he chooses to develop his
knight to the f3-square, and not necessarily on the fifth move, as in this
diagrammed position. --- Usually White plays a4 loosening up our queenside
pawn front, and follows with a later c3, engaging us in some heavy duty
strategic manoeuvring. The positions reached remain flexible with multiple
possible set-ups, and I would flood the intro to this chapter with diagrams if
I pasted every position you need to know! In Wizard of Oz-like fashion, the
positions tend to begin quietly in black and white, and only later may burst
into brilliant colour. --- We also look at the elusive Hippopotamus formation,
which normally drives the aggressive white player crazy with frustration,
mainly because we refuse to provide him with a target. Whichever way he tries
to open the position, we sidestep and close, laying in wait for our proper
time to engage him. --- And, finally, we examine the somewhat milquetoast and
fading Old Classical set-up for White with 4 Nf3 and 5 Be2. In this case Black
has nothing to fear, as we enter an extinct volcano. Our plan ...b5, ...Nd7,

{. An excruciatingly difficult test doesn't always have to be synonymous with
pain. This chapter, more than any other in the book, requires meticulous
preparation on our part. In the Austrian Attack, Black lives on the brink,
like a person with a congenital heart defect who is never confident he will
wake up the next morning. But cheer up, the danger is not one sided. White
expands at full throttle and often finds himself at risk of overextension. ---
A radical idea generally first takes hold on the fringes and only then slowly
creeps toward the consensus of the middle. The theory that an early ...c5
thrust 'must' be played is something of a universal article of faith in the
chess world. However, a plan is not a signed contract. We can change it if
need arises. In this book we abandon the theoretical move 8...c5, which chips
away at White's centre but dangerously opens the position before we are ready
to do so, and replace it with the bizarre-looking 8...Nh6 when we implement a
light-square strategy with ...Nb6 and ...Qd7 to follow. This is based on the
theory: just because someone uses a tool incorrectly doesn't prove the tool is
without value. In this case the early ...c5, at the time of this writing,
remains in some theoretical danger. So let's make the switch to the ...Nh6
plan, which so far has scored well for Black.} *

1. e4 g6 2. d4 Bg7 3. Nc3 d6 4. Be3 {QUESTION: Aren't you in the wrong
chapter? --- ANSWER: It's important to know that the 4 Be3 line can also
transpose to the Austrian Attack. Remember, we don't know where White's f-pawn
ends up. It may stay where it lies on f2, push up one to f3, or in this case
move up two to reach the Austrian Attack.} a6 5. f4 b5 {QUESTION: Didn't you
say it was more accurate to play ...Nd7 before playing ...b5? --- ANSWER: I
did, but that was in another chapter and a different set of circumstances. In
the case of the Austrian, pushing ...b5 immediately is considered the most
accurate move. Nobody said the Modern Defence was easy to master! --- QUESTION:
Why more accurate? --- ANSWER: First, Modern Godfather Tiger Hillarp Persson
gives this move order an exclam. White's e-pawn is the root of his anxiety in
the Austrian since he no longer has access to f3. By playing an early ...b5 we
prepare to hit e4 with ...Bb7. Also, a future ...b4 may undermine the
c3-knight's support for the e-pawn.} 6. Bd3 ({

deteriorating position has a way of prompting rash action, like a man who, in
a moment of passion, proposes to the girlfriend he doesn't love. --- QUESTION:
What weakness? He controls central space and follows principle by attacking.
--- ANSWER: Here is the trouble: -- 1. White's queenside pieces are
undeveloped into a jumble, so in effect, he launches an attack when behind in
development. White's lazy bishop for now radiates its unbishopness, and
masquerades as a glorified pawn. -- 2. While it's true that White controls
central space, his centre is under siege at every possible point: c3, d4 and
soon Black will also play ...f6. This means the centre and queenside are sure
to open - not good if you are the attacking side.} ({

1. e4 g6 2. d4 Bg7 3. Nc3 d6 4. Be3 a6 5. f4 b5 6. Be2 {QUESTION: Why would
White develop the bishop to a passive square when d3 is available? --- ANSWER:
In the main line of this chapter White usually goes for the set-up Bd3, e5 and
Be4. In the 6 Be2 line White seeks a similar plan: Be2, Bf3 and e5. ---
QUESTION: So are the two lines essentially equivalent? --- ANSWER: I don't
think so. We can mess White up in this one, since his plan contains the seed
of a few flaws in both scenarios: -- 1. If we play 6...Nd7 and he responds
with 7 Bf3, then we play 7...e5!, which throws a monkey wrench into the works
of his plan. -- 2. If we play 6...Nd7 and he responds with 7 e5 we simply move
our rook to b8. White's problem now is his bishop sitting on f3 eats up the
g1-knight's best square. Also, Black generally castles kingside sooner or
later in this line. If this is the case, then why did White aim his

1. e4 g6 2. d4 Bg7 3. Nc3 d6 4. Bg5 {. Unhappily, chess is one of those
endeavours where kindness and a lack of killer instinct constitute anything
but virtues. An opponent who fires his bishop off to the mysterious g5-square
on the fourth move is very likely one who is out to mate you quickly. A move
like this may appear rather thuggish to us refined Modern folk (it is!), but I
must remind you that religious ritual tends to appear as vapid, insincere
dogma to those without faith. The Bg5-loving opponent definitely generates
faith in his or her own ability to deliver checkmate. We all jealously guard
that part of our chess which emphasizes our uniqueness, and White does just
that. --- White's position remains quite flexible. He may play Qd2 and follow
with Nf3, or even f4, with a hybrid of Chapters Two and Three from this book.
Often though, White gets inferior versions since his d4 point is less well
protected than normal.} *

1. e4 d6 2. d4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. Bg5 {QUESTION: What is the purpose of placing
the bishop on g5 when there is no black knight yet on f6? --- ANSWER: This is
the line I suggested for White in my Veresov book, since it suits the super-aggressive, Type-A chess personality who always plays for mate. The line is
quite similar to White's plans in Chapters Two and Three: White normally plays
Qd2 which keeps his f-pawn flexible: f4, and sometimes Nf3, often follow. The
bishop on g5 inhibits Black from playing either ...e6 Hippo lines, or ...e5.
--- QUESTION: Is there a downside to White's plan? --- ANSWER: The downside:
White's grip on d4 is less firm than in the Be3 lines, and we often base our
counterplay on this fact.} a6 {We still play our ...a6 plan, statistically the
highest scoring, despite the alteration from White.} ({

White lacks the bypass move g5, again, due to the unfortunate placement of his

1. e4 g6 ({I endured long-standing residual resentment against the move Bc4,
dating back to the summer of 1968. It was then, on a family camping trip that
I played my first chess game against my father. Dad, taking White, made the

Hippopotamus (which I owned but can't find now; some irresponsible student

isn't that I dislike Black's position. It's more that it gives White the kind

of removing White's fun from the position and bogging him down in strategic
swamp land.})) 5. Bg5 $6 {They all seem to play this move without thought,

while I prefer the less Pircish Hippopotamus formation versus the Bc4 guys.
--- QUESTION: What is the reason for your preference? --- ANSWER: The
following reasons: -- 1. It's easy to remember. Just always play Hippo versus
virtually any white set-up with Bc4. -- 2. From my experience against the
thuggish Cro-Magnon Bc4 lines, White players always seem to have just one plan
in mind: Qe2 and then stuff their e-pawn into our position with the disruptive
e5 and sometimes e6. By playing the ...e6 Hippo set-ups, we render White's e5
plan ineffective. --- QUESTION: Why ineffective? --- ANSWER: The second White
plays e5, we slip by with ...d5 and bog White down in a nice French-style
structure, where we frustrate White's attempts to open the position. -- 3.
White's bishop, besides hitting a wall on e6, is vulnerable to ...Ne7 and ...d5, once again steering the game into weird hybrid French Defence-like
positions, not unfavourable for us. -- 4. Lastly, if Black plays in Pirc style

slow kingside pawn expansion and possible attack against White's king. Also,
never condemn a move just because it looks ugly. Only the idea behind a move

1. e4 g6 2. d4 Bg7 3. Nc3 d6 4. g3 {I heartily agree with IM John Watson, who
called the Fianchetto line "annoying". --- QUESTION: What is annoying about
it? --- ANSWER: Much like the c3 lines we look at next chapter, the Fianchetto
variation is ultra solid for White, and offers us few targets of attack.
Basically, White hopes to squeeze us with his extra space, normally with slow
kingside expansion.} ({In the last game of the chapter we look at} 4. Nge2 {
. Tiger called this move order "somewhat trickier than 4 g3, since it leaves
Black guessing what will come next." Now our problem is if we play} Nc6 {

Be3 $1 {throwing us off our ...a6 stride.}) 4... Nc6 {British GMs, like Jon
Speelman and Nigel Davies, found a good solution to try and rouse White into
action: provocation! --- QUESTION: Don't we lose time initiating the
provocation? --- ANSWER: All of White's 'time' gains come in the form of pawn
moves, like d4-d5 and f2-f4; neither of which help his development.} 5. d5 $5 {

takes time out to pinch White in the centre. --- QUESTION: Shouldn't we be
worried about White's attacking chances stemming from his massive space? ---
ANSWER: What attack? Think about it this way. Imagine White begins the game
with an Austrian Attack structure, then on a whim fianchettoes on the kingside,
which makes no sense. Well, that is basically what we have here, although you
may well point out that both d5 and f4 were free moves for White. And in case
you were wondering about the stats: Black scores 83% from this position - not
so bad!} 8. Nf3 {

behind in development. The crucial ingredient in the assessment, as mentioned
before, is that most of White's 'free' moves were non-developmental pawn moves.

could challenge the knight the other way and increase his development with}

would play. Having studied and being a fan of Jon Speelman's games, I have

1. e4 g6 2. d4 Bg7 3. Nf3 d6 4. c3 {. The c3 line proves to be the surly,
uncooperative co-worker whom everyone in the office dislikes. In some chapters
of this book you may feel inundated with data which you have trouble
assimilating. This chapter isn't one of them! People who play the early c3
lines are normally ultra-safe players who tend to want to avoid a fight (i.e.
your writer!). They usually play the line because the positions are quiet and
easy to learn. Equalizing with Black is easy (which is a bit like saying: "I'm
really good at tic-tac-toe!"); on the other hand, finding dynamic winning
chances is not so easy. --- I suggest two ways to try and stir up a fight in
the chapter. Firstly, we can provoke with an early ...Nc6. If White pushes his
d-pawn we get our imbalanced position. A word of warning: don't underestimate
this line. The c3 system's unseen dulling influence, seemingly written in
invisible ink, can insidiously turn visibly deadly. If Black sits around,
White slowly makes space gains on the queenside so we must remain aggressive.
Secondly, we have an even more radical option: play ...c5 and ...Nc6!?. When
White kicks us with d5, we send our knight to the rim with ...Na5, after which
we arrive in a sharp King's Indian-like position.} *

possibility of c3-Sicilian position transpositions.}) 4. Nf3 {We reach the
starting position of Coward's Variation, my favourite line versus the Modern
when I'm White. --- QUESTION: Why do you call it Coward's Variation? ---
ANSWER: First, any line I play tends to distinctly veer in that direction!
This is about the safest way White can meet Modern. Going c3 bolsters the d4
point and White hopes for something with his space edge, without handing Black
even a trace of counterplay. Tiger calls this line "Lazy Variation" because it
is so simple to play for White. Basically, this line vacuums the position of
sharpness as White forces a game of trench warfare instead. --- QUESTION: Do
you think White can force an edge with it? --- ANSWER: No. In fact, there are
multiple equalizing methods. However, if you are playing for a win as Black -
and most Modern players tend to be combative, stick-it-to-the-man types - the
trouble for us in this line is to find ideas which allow us dynamic potential.
Not such an easy job!} ({Before moving on,} 4. f4 {is another rare offshoot we

what kind of position arises. -- b) Use the white pieces to force the kind of
position you play best - even if you hand Black equality. Obviously, I am a

QUESTION: This move is a bit odd, correct? --- ANSWER: Correct. IM Aldama is
gifted tactically, but often shaky when it comes to theoretical disputes, so
he tosses in an odd move to try and throw off, and provoke his easily confused
opponent - and it works like a charm! The move ...c5 itself isn't so weird.

is a stylistic bias. Here we may witness a collision of expectations derived
through alternative assessments. White thinks he stands better - and so does
Black! In my opinion, White's long-term benefits outweigh the risks to his king.

books and pops up at us once in a while. --- QUESTION: What is the point of
Be3 without Nc3? --- ANSWER: We enter yet another episode of White's endless
attempts to trick us into some kind of King's Indian line where we mistakenly
toss in some non-KID move by accident. --- QUESTION: The move looks quite
reasonable for White since he can always transpose to Chapter One with Nc3 and

Sometimes we must play the hand we are dealt, rather than the one we wish for.
In this case Black gets a nice position no matter how White continues from
this point. Also, I remind you again: this line is purely voluntary from

actual age, with a hard life written all over his face. To White's surprise,
Black reaches into his saddle bag and pulls out a bowie blade he kept hidden
there, as the two hanging but not so hanging black rooks loom over White like
death. --- SUMMARY: If you don't care for the positions we get after 3 Be3

exploit. -- 2. Black's king lurks about in the centre, but this may turn into

controls that key square as well. -- 4. Who, weirdly enough, seems to have

into rage. Obviously, such a move is irrevocable, like the sound of a door
slamming shut on a parting, divorcing couple. In giving up the piece Bareev
hands Moro a load of practical difficulties on his defensive plate. Keep in
mind, a brilliant positional player like Bareev doesn't give up a piece
lightly in an ending. In doing so he acknowledges his strategic difficulties
and takes the nuclear option. He also forces Moro to strain his cerebral

A harmless line, where White hopes to inoculate himself from the temptation of
launching an early attack. It has been my experience that opponents who play
this move do so by instinct rather than from a defined plan. This check,
played quite often by White, is exactly what Black wants. --- QUESTION: Isn't
the move disruptive for Black? --- ANSWER: Not at all; Black nearly always
needs ...f6 anyway. Compare to the Janosevic-Suttles game from the Introduction.
In that game White also played Bg5 to induce ...f6, a move Black wanted anyway.

White plays the same move, but after losing a tempo with 7 Bg5+, which renders
the f4 thrust not so dangerous for Black.} ({

optimally posted after 26 Bd5? --- ANSWER: It is, but the bishop shoots off

you saying Karpov shouldn't have pushed his queenside pawns? --- ANSWER: No,
that would be like dumping a full pack of doggie treats on the floor and then

rampage. --- QUESTION: You see all this in the h-pawn's march? --- ANSWER: I
do. Don't you? The moral: sometimes an experiment assumes power more terrible
and awesome than anything the creator conceived in their most fevered
imaginings!} 20. Bh1 {The bishop, unhappy with his current reputation, takes
on a new and far more humble persona on h1.} g5 {A strategic nightmare for
White: -- 1. White's bishop, technically alive on h1, is no more than living
flesh without will. No power on earth is capable of rousing the bishop from
his snoring, drunken sleep. -- 2. Black rules over the key e5-square. -- 3. If
the game opens on the queenside, White will find himself effectively a piece
down, thanks to his h1-bishop. -- 4. White's king lives unhappily in crowded

times.} 21. Kf2 Ng6 22. Rg1 Bf6 23. Ndxf4 $5 {White swallows the
antidepressant, which has the effect of numbing all feelings - good or bad,
and goes ahead and sacs. This is a measure of White's deepening antipathy
toward the hated, unwelcome visitors on f4 and h3. Beset from all fronts, he
implements a radical solution to his compromised situation, which continues
its steady deterioration from every angle. White reasons that only with such a
cataclysmic course can he hope to obliterate the hopelessness of the normal
course of events. --- QUESTION: Isn't this suicide to enter an ending with
only two pawns for the piece? --- ANSWER: Don't throw a brick at your
television just because you don't approve of the programme. If all your forces
have been forced south, then there is only one direction for the counterattack.
The sac is indeed suicide, but it's also suicide not to play the move! Black
can then eventually open the queenside, when White finds himself effectively
down a piece, thanks to the deadweight on h1. White's desperate sac hopes to
arrest the rapidly forming fungus and decay.} Nxf4 24. Nxf4 Bd4+ $1 {A nice zwischenzug, after which White must cough up an entire rook, rather than just one

chapter we continue along and fill the theoretical vacuum with more Averbakh
lines, but this time slightly unusual choices from White. In essence, only one
game in this chapter, Nielsen-Rogers, is of any worry to us theoretically.
There White opts to enter the queenless middlegame, just as he did in the
first two games of Chapter Nine, but this time he replaces e4 with the more
useful Nf3, a developing move. So he gets a slightly better version than last
chapter. Still, this is not a sky-is-falling issue. Just study Rogers'
defensive technique carefully and you will have the position under control.} *

declined a draw two pawns down against me (well, okay, he had some
compensation for the pawns and he probably sensed he faced an inept opponent!),

Black. Also, these queenless middlegames are specialized positions, meaning
White rarely gets them while we Modern players reach them far more often.

1. d4 g6 {. The Modern is kryptonite to White's anti-queen's pawn lines: the
Colle, Torre, London and Trompowsky. Not a single one of these systems works
well versus the Modern. If the anti-queen's pawns were movies, they would flop
at the box office and go straight to DVD. In every case we get either a
favourable King's Indian or Leningrad Dutch set-up, where the kingside proves
to be a tempting canvas for us to paint our grievances. The Colle is so
patently weak against the Modern that it doesn't deserve a game, and instead
simply gets chastised in the notes! The other three aren't so hot either and
prove to be a salad made with soggy lettuce.} *

viewed their rulers under the assumption that the rulers alone communicated

toward Kasparov's omniscience against English set-ups. White has the pick of
three key ones. In all three cases we can be assured of sufficient play for
Black: -- a) 5 d3 f5 6 e4 Nf6, the Botvinnik English 'V' formation. Kasparov
plays for a ...c6 and eventual ...d5 plan. -- b) 5 d3 f5 6 e3, the e3-English.

very popular in reverse, as Black against the Closed Sicilian. Once again
Kasparov refuses to develop his knight to c6, thereby avoiding a pure reversed
Closed Sicilian.} a5 $5 {QUESTION: What is the point of Black's last move? ---

pretty healthy to me. -- 3. Black's passed d-pawn chokes White's pieces and
forces him into passivity. -- 4. White's passed but isolated e-pawn represents
a weakness more than a strength, since pushing it opens the h1-a8 diagonal and
endangers White's king. -- 5. Black's pawn on a3 means big trouble for
Gurevich. He must stand constant vigil over Black's attempts to infiltrate the
seventh rank and pick off a2. --- Conclusion: White is in big trouble.} 37. Nh3
