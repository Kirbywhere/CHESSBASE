1. b3 {. The Nimzo-Larsen Attack is an ideal opening choice for players keen
to avoid mainline theory but still wanting to set their opponents problems
from the outset. In the Nimzo-Larsen, White begins 1 b3 and then develops in
hypermodern fashion - planning to undermine any central structures Black dares
to erect. A key attraction of the Nimzo-Larsen is that White can steer the
game into either sharp play or elaborate strategic battles. In this book,
International Master Cyrus Lakdawala invites you to join him in examining the
many different variations of the Nimzo-Larsen. Lakdawala studies the typical
plans and tactics for both sides, offers repertoire options for White,
provides answers to all the key questions and tells you everything you need to
know about playing the Nimzo-Larsen Attack.} -- {Cyrus Lakdawala is an

1. -- {Move by Move is a series of opening books which uses a
question-and-answer format. One of our main aims of the series is to replicate
- as much as possible - lessons between chess teachers and students. --- All
the way through, readers will be challenged to answer searching questions, to
test their skills in chess openings and indeed in other key aspects of the
game. It's our firm belief that practising your skills like this is an
excellent way to study chess openings, and to study chess in general. --- Many
thanks go to all those who have been kind enough to offer inspiration, advice
and assistance in the creation of Move by Move. We're really excited by this
series and hope that readers will share our enthusiasm. --- John Emms,

1. b3 {. In the Prajnaparamita Sutra, the Buddha asks: "Can you count, compare,
measure, conceive, imagine, perceive, touch or divide the principle of space?
Can you approach, reach or attain space? Can space even be described as
infinite?" When you begin a chess game with 1 b3, your opponents soon discover
that they go to war against a ghost and engage in battles against empty space.
If the universe is infinite, then it stands to reason that every possibility -
both physical and imagined - must find expression in a manifestation somewhere
out there. The Nimzo-Larsen Attack is an opening which fits this theory. ---
Chess is that strange realm where dimensions of form and that of imagination
interrelate and mesh. We play 1 b3, a harmless little move, allowing Black a
blank canvas, with scope to set up any way he or she desires. On our very
first move we challenge the forces of orthodoxy, who claim that we must enter
a trendy theoretical line to claim our birthright White advantage. In fact, we
cede this point and instead engage in one-on-one combat on raw chess skill,
virtually circumventing the entire opening phase (well, apart from some of the
super-sharp 1...e5 lines of the first three chapters in this book!). After 1
b3, prepare to enter realms where book knowledge grows vague, and where we
must survive only by superior adaptability to the constantly shifting
structures. In fact, our entire association with the opening phase (with the
exception of a few forcing variations) grows so tenuous that it virtually
disappears. With our first move we give license to free reign on creativity -
both ours and our opponent's. Immediately after our first move, our future
appears as a vacant lot. It is actually our opponent's response which tells us
what to build on that lot. We make our way through strange terrain of
multitudinous possibilities, diverse futures. --- The Nimzo-Larsen isn't as
much an opening as it is a composite of other openings and structural
possibilities. In hypermodern fashion - a necessary article of faith for our
line - we often allow Black to take over the centre with ...e7-e5 and ...d7-d5,
only to attack it later from the sides, and especially pressure it from the
vantage point of our fianchettoed b2-bishop. Conquest of the central dark
squares can be a key criterion of the Nimzo-Larsen.} -- (1... -- {We are our
n Messiah: -- The tendency these days is to look for an openings messiah,
order his or her books and then faithfully practice the holy teachings. We
disaffected Nimzo-Larseners, on the other hand, are sick and tired of waiting
around. So we assume the role of our own openings messiah. This book is meant
to be a block of suggestions and ideas, not commands to be followed. Most of
us tend to play better within a familiar structure. When you open with 1 b3!,
more than likely you alone will be within the familiar after a dozen or so
moves, while your opponents will wander about, strangers to the alien
environments which tend to arise from the Nimzo-Larsen. --- I view my books as
a joint venture in which you, the reader, and I participate. So I never accept
an opening book contract unless I am willing to play the opening myself. I
expected to take a hit in rating when I first took up 1 b3. In fact in my very
first game, I groaned inwardly when I barely drew with a player rated 450
points lower. Then, as I studied and understood the opening more, events began
to turn around. --- In this book you are offered a host of idiosyncratic ideas
and flights of fancy - over safer, more solid lines - and I encourage readers
to follow their imaginations when playing 1 b3. At this writing, my score with
the opening stands at 25 wins, four draws and a loss, from an opposition rated
around a 2250 average - a far higher percentage than normal scores with my
main 1 Nf3 or 1 d4 lines. Out of these games I achieved very few "+="
positions after the opening, and in most games my opponents equalized (and
sometimes stood better!). Yet their troubles arose from the middlegame on. So
what was the game changer? Opponents tended to react poorly to the
bizarrification of the positions, ate up too much time on their clocks and
began to grow disoriented, which in turn, induced inexplicable errors from
such strong players. Don't underestimate the weaponization of the outlandish!})
({In this position, the Nimzo-Larsen Blackmar-Diemer Gambit, I had White
against GM Tamaz Gelashvili at the National Open rapid chess championship. The
opening went} 1... d5 2. Bb2 Bg4 3. f3 $5 Bf5 4. e4 $5 {. Now my scary strong
opponent, rated USCF 2668, later outplayed me but I hung on to the draw anyway,
mainly because he burned so much of his clock dealing with a completely new
set of opening problems, whereas I banged out my moves quickly. Why? Because
we cover this position in Chapter Seven. So what is bizarre and unfamiliar to
the opponent is merely routine, familiar ground for us, the Nimzo-Larsen clan.}
) (1... -- {The Division of the Book: -- The book is, in a sense, dissected
into two gigantic chapters: 1 b3 e5 lines, and 1 b3 and everything else lines!
Chapters One, Two and Three, the largest in the book, cover the
confrontational 1...e5 variations, which you do indeed need to study and, yes,
even memorize parts of, since the lines tend to be forcing and quite
mathematical. It is in these lines that we are vulnerable to home prep and a
crafty opponent's computer analysis, so we must work hardest here in the book.
Nevertheless, there is still plenty of room for imagination to frolic. Then we
have Chapters Four through Ten, 1 b3 versus everything else. These lines tend
not to engage in early confrontation, and therefore allow us to do some really
strange things, which I, your enabler, encourage throughout the book!}) (1...
-- {The History of the Nimzo-Larsen: -- In the 1920s and 30s, Aaron
Nimzowitsch scored over 80% with 1 b3, and 1 Nf3, 2 b3. Surprisingly, he
played the latter 1 Nf3 move order far more often than the purist 1 b3 version.
He mostly got reversed Nimzo-Indian positions, as examined in Chapter Five,
which he understood more deeply than virtually all his opponents. --- Larsen,
too, did very well with his namesake opening, scoring an impressive 80%,
mainly with the 1 b3 move order. Yet, paradoxically, our opening was hit with
a terrible setback from a public relations standpoint, when then world
champion Boris Spassky dismantled our hero, Larsen in a mere 17 moves in a
high-stakes game at the USSR vs. Rest of the World match in Belgrade, 1970. It
was painful to watch and not much of a contest. On the one side we observed a
salivating cat and on the other a quaking hamster. Somehow this massacre
embedded itself in our collective consciousness and now most players associate
1 b3?! with the Larsen-Spassky debacle. I have cunningly hidden this game,
embedded somewhere in the notes of the book and refuse to annotate this
embarrassment - unless, of course, I end up writing Spassky: Move by Move! (In
which case I would no doubt extol and wax poetically over the glories of
Spassky's sumptuous attacking skills!) --- Fischer, in an experimental mood,
took up the opening's mantle in the early 70s, racking up a perfect 5-0 score,
an act which injected our Nimzo-Larsen spirits with a considerable boost of
confidence - although most players didn't attribute Fischer's success to the
powers of the Nimzo-Larsen itself, since at the time Fischer slaughtered
opponents at unheard-of margins with every opening. Then there followed four
decades of dormancy - a lengthy convalescence period (to recover from the
Larsen-Spassky game!) - where our opening was left untouched, like rotten
cheese past its expiration date, by the upper echelon of chess.}) *

{A New, Hallucinatory Era for} 1. b3 {! --- Fortunately, a violin doesn't lose
its tone if left unplayed by a maestro for a long period of time. In the
present, our hibernating opening awakens to its old power and glory, none the
worse for its disuse. Today, we arrive upon the threshold of a new era for our
opening. Armenian GM Tigran L. Petrosian and Georgian super-GM - rated over
2700 - Baadur Jobaba play 1 b3 regularly and with success. Modern GMs
interpret the opening in a kind of high-end crazy formulation, inspiring a new
generation of Nimzo-Larseners. Their play sparkles with anticipatory,
child-like freshness, as we try and guess (almost always incorrectly!) their
coming moves. --- When the Duke of Wellington was asked what his orders were
in case he was killed in the Battle of Waterloo, he responded: "To do like
me!" And so now we steal a glimpse of our top general's modern interpretations
of our line. (I sneaked in a diagram of one of my games as well. Okay, fine,
I'm not included in the list of top Nimzo-Larsen generals, but I certainly
qualify as newly enlisted zealot in our war!) Here is just a taste of some of
the positions examined in the coming chapters. In each case White submerges
himself in fanciful notions and dark alchemies and, in each case, White, the
Nimzo-Larsener, functions and pushes forward upon the wind of a fundamentally
optimistic premise: I will survive the complications and you, my bewildered
opponent, won't - and in each case they were correct! Behold that
hallucinatory, strategy-less netherworld, called the Nimzo-Larsen, where all
futures are possible:} -- (1... e5 2. Bb2 Nc6 3. e3 Nf6 4. Bb5 Bd6 5. Na3 a6 6.

and one would believe the book was titled: The Grob: Move by Move! The modern
interpretation of the Nimzo-Larsen is a virtual Nc3/g2-g4-fest! To the naked
eye, it appears as if White's forces in the above positions lie about in
disorderly array, like obese sunbathing tourists littered about the beach. In
each case, White unscrews the lid, and allows anarchy and unblocked creativity
to pour forth and splash as it may. --- Conversely, watch how Nimzowitsch's
greater understanding of the structure guides him to the win in Game 1, A.Nimzowitsch-H.Johner, Exhibition game, Bern 1931.}) (1... -- {Acknowledgements:

1. b3 e5 2. Bb2 Nc6 3. e3 d5 4. Bb5 Bd6 5. f4 {. When I open a game with 1 b3!,
this is my dream line. In this chapter Black declares open contempt for our
opening and promptly accepts our challenge by taking control over the centre
with ...e7-e5 and ...d7-d5. But as you can see from the diagram, it's hard to
decide whether Black's centre represents a blessing or a curse, since e5 is
under heavy assault. To my mind Black's meagre gains feel disproportionate to
the vast expenditure of energy invested in defending the optimistic enterprise.
We twist, knead and pound the beleaguered e5-property, which Black jealously
protects, to the shape of our will: -- 1. Black's pinned knight isn't much of
a defender of e5 and we may also inflict damage to his structure by chopping
the knight at a later date. -- 2. Black can't play ...e5xf4?? since g7 hangs,
so he suffers a second pin. -- 3. Nf3 is coming, and Black must either play ...Bg4 and ...Bxf3 - which negates his bishop pair advantage (remember, we will
trade on c6), leaving him with the worse structure - or will be forced to
contort further and pour more resources down the aperture of his optimistic
plan with a future ...Qe7 and ...f7-f6. -- 4. We may further enhance our
structure by playing a future f4xe5, which swaps a wing pawn for Black's
central pawn, and also opens the f-file for our rook. --- Saying all this,
let's keep our guard up, since Black's inherent freedom and coming piece
activity can easily transform into dangerous attacks, especially if we don't
know our lines cold. I mentioned in the introduction to the book that 1 b3 is
basically an intuitive opening, without much need for memorization. Well, in
this chapter, forget I said that! The arising positions in this chapter are
sharp, forcing lines, susceptible to computer preparation. So let's do our
homework in this chapter and rewards will follow. Wing it, and we risk
disaster.} *

please give me a blanket. Keep me warm, let me wear your coat." I agree with
you somewhat, but if White thoroughly familiarizes himself with the
complications with Fritz, Houdini et al, then it actually gets much less scary

there is no free ride for Black either in this variation.} fxe5 9. Bxc6+ bxc6

the board and blindfolded to boot. White gets a massive King's Gambit style

That which is old is now new. This move, Ray Keene's favourite, may be an
interesting try for surprise value, if your opponent expects 1 b3 and is ready
with home prep. --- QUESTION: White's last move seems rather quiet for the
given position. What is the idea? --- ANSWER: White doesn't want to go pawn
grabbing with the Blatny plan of 8 fxe5. Nor does he care to enter the
theoretical nest of 8 Nc3, so as a happy middle ground: he plays a non-threatening move, retaining the option to castle queenside. --- QUESTION: This sounds
logical. Does the plan contain any flaws? --- ANSWER: Only one tiny one: if
Black plays 8...Bg4, then after 9 h3 Bxf3 10 Qxf3 White loses a tempo, since
Qe2 turns out to be a wasted move. But the good news is that, even after the
wasted move, White stands slightly better, since he picks up Black's valuable

reckoned to be equal: Black's pieces are sufficiently active to compensate for
the worse pawn structure and it is not so easy for White to get at the
weaknesses in any case. " Black's extra space does indeed compensate him a
shade but I doubt the g2-g3 weakening amounts to much since most of the minor
pieces have been removed from the board. In the end it seems that White has
produced a touch of advantage from his structure, though this feels like a

{Some say there is no such thing as a coincidence. While I was working on this
game, I logged on to the Internet Chess Club to check for messages. I wasn't
logged on more than 10 seconds, when a blitz challenge appeared: GM Arencibia,
who I have never played before, challenged me to a game. Unfortunately, I
didn't have time to accept, since I was too busy annotating his win against
Kaidanov for this book!} 1. b3 e5 2. Bb2 Nc6 3. e3 d5 4. Bb5 Bd6 5. f4 Qe7 {
I think the version without tossing in ...Qh4+ is an inferior one for Black,

commonly played. Probably because so few people - GM's included - bother to

Nf5 17. Nf3 $1 {QUESTION: Why an unforced retreat? --- ANSWER: Sometimes the
undoing of a previous inferior idea warrants an exclam. Our egos may not be
happy with such moves since, in a sense, we humble ourselves and openly
confess a past misdeed - yet the position's requirements take precedence over
such psychologically unnerving admissions. White realizes he went on the wrong
path on g5 and returned the knight to its optimal post, where it covers d4 and
pressures e5.} Rae8 {EXERCISE (combination alert): White forces the win of a

Threatening Nxd6.} Ba3 {An arrow shot heavenward can never harm the sky. The
bishop, devoid of targets, shoots into empty space to preserve himself and

throw animosity in the direction of those who do what we do but better.
Black's jealous bishops search for hidden counterplay in a position where it
simply doesn't exist. This strange move is indicative of Kaidanov's level of
frustration.} ({QUESTION: Can Black try the desperado} 23... Rxf3 $5 24. gxf3

God remained indifferent to the matter, decided to take up the task himself.

suggestion is an excellent practical try, but White can accept the first sac

1. b3 e5 2. Bb2 d6 {. In this chapter, the largest of the book, we cover
various ...e7-e5 and ...d7-d6 structures, designed by our opponents to
accommodate their King's Indian or Dutch prejudices. Believe it or not, this
chapter may be our greatest challenge of the book, since we lose our
familiarity advantage. Black remains within a KID/Dutch structure, which he or
she may play regularly against queen's pawn openings and the English. The
Nimzo-Larsener has a choice of two elemental structures:} 3. -- ({1. White fianchettoes his light-squared bishop, when we reach an English versus KID or
Dutch. Examples of both KID and Dutch set-ups: --} 3. c4 f5 4. g3 Nf6 5. Bg2 g6

So our main decision is: do you prefer the English Opening or a reversed
French structure? My advice is to test both and see which one gives you better
results, and then stick with that one for a while, until understanding and
familiarity grow. However, our true goal should be eventually to play both,
and be equally fluent in both structures.}) *

what if Black changes his mind and plays} 4... d5 {, after which White has
been tricked into some kind of reversed Modern Defence? --- ANSWER: Well, we
are in a Modern Defence structure, and in a passive Hippopotamus version to
boot, but this line doesn't represent much of a concern to us since we are up
two full tempi over normal. Our first tempo is simply due to the fact that we
play the Modern with the white pieces. The second is that Black took two moves
to play ...d7-d6-d5. This alone allows us to face the future confidently.
Moreover, I only see one game in the database where Black played this way, so
it isn't likely you will face such a situation over the board. --- QUESTION:
What is the Hippopotamus formation? --- ANSWER: We play e2-e3 and d2-d3,
developing our knights to e2 and d2, retaining maximum flexibility for our

e3 {structure. --- QUESTION: What is the difference? --- ANSWER: White saves
time by posting the knight on f3 in just one move. With the e2-e3/Ne2
structure, White slightly weakens his light squares but greatly enhances
structural flexibility as well. For example, he can meet a ...g6-g5 storm with
f2-f4!, challenging it head on for space on the kingside. My personal

this chapter. Moreover, if we are purists and use the 1 b3 move order, we
don't even allow this position, since after 1...f5 2 Bb2 we meet 2...Nf6 with

and solid Old Indian set-up. Here passivity isn't much of an issue since it
can be argued that White set up passively as well. --- QUESTION: What is
Black's normal formation in the Old Indian? --- ANSWER: Black usually plays
the position as if it was a Philidor against 1 e4. Thus: ...e7-e5, ...d7-d6, ...Nf6, ...Be7, ...Nbd7, ...0-0, ...c7-c6, ...Re8, ...a7-a6 and, if he can

you consider 30...f5 - ? Or is the move simply suicide for Black?} Ne4 $2 {
The knight lands with an undignified flop on e4, after which it creates an

1. b3 e5 2. Bb2 d6 3. c4 f5 4. g3 Nf6 5. Bg2 Be7 {Black prefers to set up in
Dutch Style, foregoing King's Indian structures. --- QUESTION: What are the
differences? --- ANSWER: The Dutch version is perhaps even more aggressive
than the KID: -- 1. Black doesn't have a pawn on g6, so he can sometimes go
for a direct kingside assault plan similar to a Grand Prix Sicilian, with ...Qe8,
... Qh5, ...f5-f4, ...Bh3 and ...Ng4. -- 2. Black can even try for ...g7-g5 in one go, to begin a kingside pawn avalanche. -- 3. Black's bishop is
posted on e7 rather than the KID g7-square. This means his e5 point is
slightly more vulnerable to pressure from White with Bb2, f2-f4 and even d2-d4
ideas. --- QUESTION: Black's bishop looks out of sorts on e7 when compared to
g7. How will he ever get the piece into play? --- ANSWER: The structure
eventually changes and Black's bishop sometimes emerges along the g1-a7
diagonal, often via d8 and b6. Sometimes the bishop transfers to f6, mimicking
a KID fianchetto.} 6. e3 {

castling. Note that Black lost central influence and really can't castle

option.} 10. Nbc3 Qh5 11. Qd2 {QUESTION: Isn't this an odd spot for White's

since the square will be White's most vulnerable spot as soon as he plays
f2-f4.} Nc5 $5 {A new move in the position. Perhaps Black intends ...e5-e4. Of
course, I won't give him the time, since his knight receives the heave-ho next

you allow your opponent a protected, passed e-pawn? --- ANSWER: Black's e-pawn

it keeps your king safer.} ({I didn't want to open the g-file after} 15. gxf4

no more than a happy accident, like some scientific discovery blundered upon

you just asking for a loss of more time with your move? --- ANSWER: I concede
that my knight spends an eternity on what should be a trivially simple errand.

hundredfold.} 1-0

fool?" Rowson explains: "On the one hand this move simply loses a tempo, but
because the bishop was on b5 Black developed his pieces to relatively passive
squares, so although the tempo was 'lost' it was not entirely 'wasted'." Have
you noticed that in many of Larsen's games, order and logic have a nasty habit

Larsen, eager to look inside, unwinds the string which binds the package. A

which fulfils the principle: Counter in the centre when attacked on the wing.

Black's forces whisk themselves to nowhere. --- In this instance, Black should
embrace the reality that his attack, which never really began, is now over for
good. But Andersson can't seem to keep away from Larsen's king, much like an
ex-smoker who now hangs out with co-workers who smoke, just to get a whiff of
the old addiction second-hand. So Andersson falls prey to one of those
impulses where he knows what he does is wrong, and that he should know better,
yet can't help himself from following the temptation of idealistically

Davies, who felt the move was too passive. --- QUESTION: Do you agree? ---
ANSWER: I disagree with Davies in this instance. His "passive" label is
absolutely correct. But what about White's moves? Are they not equally
inoffensive? In essence the quietness of both sides tend to cancel each other
out, and I believe Black's move is completely playable.} 5. Ne2 $5 {QUESTION: What are the differences between the knight development to e2 and its
counterpart f3, which we looked at in the previous game? --- ANSWER: When
White develops the knight to e2: -- 1. White pretty much agrees to the loss of
the bishop pair, since his b5-bishop lacks a retreat square to e2, as Larsen
demonstrated last game. -- 2. White's structure looks more flexible, and he
has options of a future f2-f4, since his f-pawn is unobstructed. -- 3. We deny
Black annoying pseudo Alekhine's ...e5-e4 ideas, since now the move won't cost
White a tempo. -- 4. White can play for a kingside attack with Ng3 (in
conjunction with f2-f4). --- Conclusion: In my opinion, knight development to
e2 is White's more dynamic option.} Bd7 6. O-O Be7 ({After} 6... a6 7. Bxc6

1. b3 e5 2. Bb2 Nc6 3. e3 Nf6 4. Bb5 Bd6 5. Na3 {. This odd, fragmentary line,
with its manifold, intricate byways, has the power to befuddle both Black and
White. The diagrammed position above looks like a game between inebriated
beginners at a bar - the loser to pay for the next round of drinks - and has
to be one of the most outlandish tabiya positions in memory. Matters progress
in ever more bugged out fashion from here on, where White's antisocial
a3-knight often heads for c2 or even back to b1. Meanwhile Black, striving not
to be outdone in this contest of the unnatural, plugs up queenside development
by posting his bishop on what looks like its worst possible outpost on d6. ---
Black's intent, as explained in more detail in the first game of the chapter,
is to engineer a future ...d7-d5, without wasting an earlier tempo on ...d7-d6.
The even stranger part is that the state of current theory suggests this line
may be Black's optimum choice versus our Nimzo-Larsen, and is the current
darling of many of the world's top GMs, suggesting that we had better give
this line respect. --- After I sent Everyman this chapter, editor GM John Emms
described the variation perfectly in his email response: "I don't think I'll
use this line to teach kids about opening play!"} *

1. b3 ({Let's compare our line with the following popular variation of the
Four Knights:} 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bb5 Bd6 {. QUESTION: Wow!
This move looks awful! Black blocks his d-pawn, which gums up queenside
development. What is the idea? --- ANSWER: Now you know why I dubbed this line
the Beginner's Variation. We arrive at one of those anomalous positions which
looks terrible for Black but just isn't if we understand the ideas behind it.
IM Richard Palliser writes of the line: "When this first became popular in the
late nineties it looked provocative and trendy, but time has shown that the
bishop move very much deserves consideration as one of the main lines of the
Nimzowitsch-Larsen." Black's idea is to play in a Ruy Lopez Marshall Gambit
style with ...0-0, ...h7-h6, ...Re8, ...Bf8 and ...d7-d5.}) 1... e5 2. Bb2 Nc6
3. e3 Nf6 4. Bb5 Bd6 $5 {QUESTION: What does the bishop's placement on d6 have
to do with the Ruy Lopez? --- ANSWER: Normally, in Lopez situations, Black
must first play ...d7-d6 to support the e-pawn, and only then proceed with the
moves (in many different orders): ...Be7,...0-0, ...Re8,...Bf8 and then a
possible freeing break ...d6-d5. --- The difference in the Beginner's
Variation is that Black didn't waste a tempo on ...d7-d6. The bishop did the
work of the d-pawn instead. So the idea is quite clever and its popularity
from Black's side at the highest level speaks for itself. In fact, don't
expect to extract an opening edge in this chapter against a booked-up opponent.

QUESTION: Why lose a tempo? --- ANSWER: Well, I believe White gets a better
shot at an edge if he chops on c6. But it isn't a bad idea to keep an opponent
off balance by tossing in this lesser played line. Withdrawing the bishop to
e2 generates the strategic threat of Nc4.}) 6... Qe7 {Dang. My opponent was
prepared for the Be2 line as well. --- QUESTION: Why does Black deliberately
walk into a tempo loss on the d6-bishop? --- ANSWER: Two reasons: -- 1. His
bishop is misplaced on d6 and must move sooner or later anyway, so it really
doesn't constitute a loss of tempo. -- 2. When White's knight plays to c4,
eventually, Black regains the tempo with ...d7-d5 or ...b7-b5.} ({

Black challenges e5. However, tactics intercede and Black, already in a

personal preference. Theory hasn't quite decided if one path is superior to

Nimzowitsch! Wouldn't you agree that this move is a reckless departure from

perceptible negative aftermath. Social pressures nearly always outweigh
rational thought, but not in Petrosian's case. This abstractionist painter's
move is also frowned upon by that tiresome goody two-shoes, Houdini, yet given
an enthusiastic two thumbs up by your orthodoxy-hating writer. What other
opening can you think of which whisks you off into such strange realms this
early on in the game? --- Petrosian, who mixes entreaties with just a hint of
possible violence - just in case his wishes are denied - decides to spike the

1. b3 e5 2. Bb2 Nc6 3. e3 Nf6 4. Bb5 Bd6 5. Na3 Na5 {In this case Black
doesn't even bother with ...a7-a6 and immediately transfers his knight to a5,
to dodge any Bxc6 options and intercept White's Nc4 intention. --- QUESTION:
But isn't ...a7-a6 a tempo gain for Black? --- ANSWER: -- 1. Not if White
chops on c6. -- 2. Not if White's bishop is better posted on e2, than on b5.
-- 3. And what is the rush? ...a7-a6 or ...c7-c6 tempo gains will still be
there, as long as White's bishop remains on b5. -- 4. When the bishop sits on
b5, an unfavourable post, White will be disinclined to play c2-c4, a move he
may need to challenge Black's central superiority.} 6. Be2 {

In the final game of the chapter we examine} 6. Nc4 {.}) 6... a6 {Transposing
to the previous game with a retrograde tempo "gain"! Black opens possibilities
of ...b7-b5.} 7. c4 {As in Petrosian-Vishnu, White decides he needs to
challenge Black's space advantage with a pawn to the fourth rank. --- QUESTION:
Didn't Black's early ...Na5 strategy backfire? His knight looks silly on a5.
--- ANSWER: As does White's a3-knight! One of the reasons I am a new and
zealous convert to the Nimzo-Larsen is that we reach such bizarro opening
landscapes like this one. It is almost as if the players were engaged in a
FischerRandom game of pre-chess, rather than real chess.} ({

12. Kxd2 {. QUESTION: Didn't White lose the right to castle here as well? ---

his king. I prefer White in this ending, who has the superior pawn structure
and isn't even behind in development.}) 8... Nc6 ({QUESTION: Isn't} 8... e4 {

unless White is willing to commit to} 11. e4 $5 {.}) 11... Qe7 12. Nb1 $5 {
QUESTION: Why undevelop when c2 is available for the knight? --- ANSWER: c2
may be quicker, but it is also an inferior square to d2. Both sides lost huge
amounts of time, so in this case White reasons that quality trumps quantity,
and his last move is the correct decision.} ({Otherwise} 12. e4 {is an idea for White if you don't care for Hedgehog structures. It looks like an English Opening
with chances for both sides. Play may go} d6 13. Nc2 {intending Ne3 next.})
12... d5 {QUESTION: Haven't we arrived in a Hedgehog formation, found in the
Taimanov Sicilian, in reverse? --- ANSWER: We have. --- QUESTION: But what do
we do if we don't play such positions from either side!? --- ANSWER: As I
mentioned in the above note, you can toss in an earlier e3-e4. But you must
factor in that your opponent is probably going to be as confused as you are -
or more so - in such a baffling series of transpositions. The very nature of
the Nimzo-Larsen is that you always seem to land in something else, a
facsimile of some other opening! And we should be ready for just such a
contingency. --- It's not a bad idea to take a look at a few games with the
Taimanov Sicilian. GM John Emms wrote a Move by Move book on the Taimanov and
is an expert on the line. I do admit that in such Hedgehog structures it's
difficult to get a clean grip upon the flux of the correct plan (in this case,
White angles for d3-d4, since b3-b4 will be next to impossible to achieve),
which feels inconsistent, shifting and always in motion, since the expanding
side (Black, in this case) may throw all kinds of pawn storms and central
strikes your way.} ({Black can also refrain from ...d7-d5 and go for} 12... b5

Hoping to loosen the black queenside.} b6 16. Rfe1 {A useful move in such

a kingside assault with} 16... Rae8 {, intending ...Kh8 and ...f7-f5.}) 17. Bf1
a5 {Black clamps down on White b3-b4 breaks, grabs more space, and thinks
about a future ...a5-a4, at the cost of weakening the b5-square.} 18. a3 Rad8 (
18... a4 {looks premature due to} 19. bxa4 {

20. d4 $1 {.}) 19. g3 $1 {Dual purpose: -- 1. Now e3-e4 is a possibility,

The human move, to vacate the queen from the c-file.} ({

and White remains a pawn up.}) (20... e4 21. Bc4 $1 Nf6 22. Ng5 {
with the initiative for White, who menaces f7 and c5.})) 20... Qd8 {
Black removes his queen from the vulnerable, soon-to-be-opened e-file.} 21. d4
$1 {A thematic and well-timed break. --- QUESTION: What makes this break well
timed? --- ANSWER: Black doesn't have the option of ...e5-e4, since White
controls this square.} exd4 22. exd4 cxd4 23. Nxd4 Nxd4 24. Bxd4 {White's piece
are slightly more active and his structure is a tad more sound on the
queenside.} Ne7 $2 {QUESTION: Why did Black retreat an already centralized
piece? --- ANSWER: To speculate on motivation isn't easy. All I can tell you
is that the move lands Black in trouble. Contradictory impulses begin to chase
one another in Black's mind, as he abruptly alters course with this
vacillating motion. He frets over imagined deficiencies of his king's position,
and his attempt to remedy the trouble only manages to inflame it. With this
move Black contradicts his previous ten. He fears for his king and seeks to
add a defender to g6, but in doing so he violates the principle: Avoid
unnecessary retreats or decentralizations in an open position.} ({
Black remains only slightly worse if he remains in an aggressive posture with} 
24... Qg5 25. Nf3 Qg4 26. Bg2 Rxe1+ 27. Rxe1 Be6 28. Qb2 {.}) 25. Ba6 $1 {
A tempo gain, since White wants to play his bishop to d3 anyway.} Rb8 26. Bd3
Ng6 {The idea behind his knight retreat. Black staunchly refuses to provide
targets of any sort for his opponent.} ({
He must be very careful about moving pawns in front of his king. For example:}

g6. White continues to poke and prod Black's kingside to create further
weakness.} Bd6 29. Nc4 Bf8 30. Bxb6 $1 {A plan conceived by caprice isn't
necessarily doomed to failure. Berkes is not a man ruled by pure strictures of
logic and is willing to gamble. In this instance he indulges in flagrant
mischief and gets away with it. With his sac, White churns fate, not knowing
his final destiny.} ({All the same, the text looks to be White best chance
from a practical standpoint. He decides to parse subtle distinctions and go
for a promising, temporary sac, rather than win a pawn by simply chopping on
g6, which loses the initiative:} 30. Bxg6 $6 {(White augments his earnings by
a pawn but, in doing so, allows Black sufficient counterplay)} Rxe1+ 31. Rxe1
hxg6 32. Qxg6 b5 33. Ne3 Qe8 {and Black, with the bishop pair and play against
White's queenside, looks fine despite being a pawn down.}) 30... Rxb6 31. Nxb6
{There is no room for misinterpretation or error, since a fraction of thought
veering in the wrong or right direction separates a draw from defeat. ---
EXERCISE (critical decision): Black can take the knight on b6, or he can swap
rooks first. Only one of these moves works. Which one?} Rxe1+ $2 {The wrong way
. Black's astonished and scattered pieces soon wilt under the pressure.} ({
ANSWER: He may well hold the game with} 31... Qxb6 $1 32. Qc4+ Kh8 33. Rxe8

Rxa5 Bxb3 41. Rxe5 {. Even here, White is the only one with winning chances,
but my feeling is Black should hold the game with the bishop pair. ---
QUESTION: Don't you think White should win, since he can push his passed
a-pawn up the board, which eventually costs Black a piece? --- ANSWER: Houdini
analysis worked out to where Black holds:} Kf7 42. Rb5 Ba4 43. Ra5 Bc6 44. Ra6
Bd5 45. a4 Be7 46. Rb6 Ke8 47. a5 Kd7 48. a6 Bc5 49. Rb8 Kc7 50. Re8 Kd7 {
, when Black's bishops and king radically circumscribe the rook's freedom and
impede the passed a-pawn's movement. The analysis goes on and on but White,
who hammers with a bent nail which stubbornly refuses entrance into the wall,
failed to make progress. This is one of those miraculous escapes where you
think to yourself: "I can't believe I didn't lose!" And yet it happened. --- I
realize this is an openings book, not one on endings, but I encourage readers
to go over this analysis. We must work on every part of the game, not just the
opening. To my mind this is a key difference between Move by Move books and
other opening books, which tend to truncate analysis after the opening - as if
that much worshipped phase of the game is the beginning, the middle and the
end of chess!}) 32. Rxe1 Qxb6 {EXERCISE (combination alert): White to play and
win. --- ANSWER: Double attack/pin.} 33. Qc4+ $1 {The queen appears with an
aura of assertion, setting up a deadly double attack on the following move.}
Kh8 34. Qf7 $1 {Threatening Bxg6, followed by Qxf8 mate, or simply Qxd7.
Black's next move is forced.} Qd8 {The queen responds to the summons with the
attitude of a murderer's mother, who greets police detectives on her doorstep
with naïve trust in her deranged sons (on d7 and f8), despite evidence to the
contrary.} 35. Bxg6 hxg6 36. Rd1 {And here is the pin. The looting begins as
rook and queen unite, striking in concert.} (36. Rd1 Be7 37. Rd4 $1 f5 38. Qd5

White, can take solace in the fact that the resulting positions morph into
deliciously weird patterns later on.}) 1-0

the structure in front of his king with the asymmetrical recklessness of an

magnificence in the conduct of his attack. --- QUESTION: Isn't White's last
move rather rash? --- ANSWER: It isn't a move I would play in a million years,
but Jobava's idea is constructed with the philosophy: a person of delicate
sensibilities isn't of much use when engaged in a death struggle. An enemy
can't be overcome through the contemplation and invocation of some abstract
concept. Instead, Jobava takes a big chance and commits himself to a weakening
but aggressive thrust. Jobava's love of adventure often overcomes his fear of
the unknown. He does receive a few benefits from the move, despite its
potential for weakening: -- 1. White goes all in for his coming kingside
attack. -- 2. Suddenly Black's queen looks rather insecure. -- 3. Such moves
have a psychological effect on the opponent, impinging upon their (and perhaps
Jobava's own!) peace of mind.} Qf4 $5 ({Houdini offers the psychotic line}

--- ANSWER: The sac is a matter of taste. Black reasons that an apathetic
response doesn't mix well when you are in crisis mode. One strange observation
is that very strong players often lose an inferior position more quickly than
weaker ones! The reason is that higher rated players are less likely to agree
to a long, grovelling defence, and much more inclined to sac - even unsoundly.}

1. b3 e5 2. Bb2 Nc6 3. e3 Nf6 4. c4 d5 5. cxd5 Nxd5 {. This is an optional
chapter. If you have experience with the black pieces in Sicilian lines such
as the Scheveningen, Najdorf, Kan or Taimanov, then you may want to invite a
reversed Open Sicilian and consider the move order 1 b3, 2 Bb2, and 3 c4 when
facing 1...e5, 2...Nc6 lines. Of course, Black can decline and opt for ...d7-d6, which transposes back into Chapter Two. But our meek-looking
Nimzo-Larsen rarely intimidates, and Black often accepts our dare and plays ...Nf6 and ...d7-d5, if not immediately, as in the diagram above, then later.
This means we are a tempo ahead in a Sicilian, but we deal with a few
restrictions: -- 1. We are committed to a queenside fianchetto, which is not
always the case in Black, tempo down versions. -- 2. Our b-pawn sits on b3,
which means that if we later play a2-a3 and b3-b4, we will be handing our
extra tempo back and then really do have the black pieces in a Sicilian! ---
The positions which arise tend to be of the more strategic Sicilian type, but
as is the case with most Nimzo-Larsen variations, the stakes continue to rise
as the games move along. An army slow to improvise is also vulnerable. So I
encourage you to test out this set-up. In any case, go for it if you seek a
change of pace from the lines in Chapter Two, and if you have Open Sicilian
experience.} *

exclamation mark? Please explain. --- ANSWER: A completely new plan of immense
gravity and far-reaching consequences takes birth. The double exclam was for
the originality of the idea: White plans Rg1 and g2-g4, after which his knight
has free reign over e4, as well as a potential attack. Today, every
Scheveningen, Najdorf, Kan and Taimanov Sicilian player is aware of such a
plan, thanks to Fischer. Of course, it entails risk for White as well, since
he voluntarily weakens his own king. But think about this: the only way for
Black to disrupt this plan is to pry open the centre - not so easy, since

Kan Sicilian. --- QUESTION: What is the point of the move, which seems to beg
Black to play ...f5-f4 - ? --- ANSWER: Several points: -- 1. White may
fianchetto his bishop quickly, keeping his king safer, rather than the
long-winded way with Be2, 0-0, Re1, Bf1, g2-g3 and Bg2. -- 2. White can play
an eventual e3-e4, without allowing Black ...Nf4. -- 3. An ...f5-f4 response
also contains problems for Black, as we shall see in the game's continuation,
since White responds with g3xf4 and then e3-e4, which opens the g-file for the
rook.} (11. Be2 {is more normal and leads to positions similar to

, as White gets a pawn and a huge central mass for the exchange - a bargain.})
12. gxf4 exf4 13. e4 {QUESTION: Who stands better here? --- ANSWER: The
position telegraphs mixed signals. Both sides possibly believed they profited
from the transaction and the parties arrive at a mutual understanding: Black
opens central lines against White's king, who now lacks safe haven across the
board. On the other hand White opens the g-file for his attack, then promptly
closes the e-file, taking over the centre.} Ne3 $1 {The knight thinks to
himself: "White's king is as good as dead." Unfortunately for him, the
conjecture turns out to be inaccurate. --- QUESTION: Isn't Black just winning
now? --- ANSWER: Admittedly this is a terrifying-looking move but White has
everything under control. The move, more impressive than powerful, lacks a key
requisite for success: White is under no compulsion to accept the offer.} 14.

19. b4 a6 20. Rc1 {QUESTION: Isn't White's king in trouble, stuck in the
centre? --- ANSWER: There is danger of course, but the white king looks no
less safe than Black's, who sits uneasily along the newly opened g-file. White
commands total central control with his e- and d-pawns, which neutralizes
Black's piece play. The only way to get at the white king would be for Black
to set up central sacs later. But if White is aware of this plan, it won't be
so easy for Black to fulfil it.} Kh8 21. Qc2 Bh5 $6 {After this inaccuracy the

1. b3 d5 2. Bb2 c5 3. e3 Nc6 4. Bb5 {. The actors are different and a few
props have been altered, but the play remains the same as in normal
Nimzo-Indians. In this chapter we arrive in reversed Nimzos a move up, albeit
with White committed to a queenside fianchetto, since we made that decision on
our very first move. Here we face the most classical of opponents, unafraid to
play the opening a full move down. The fight tends to revolve around control
over e5. We play an eventual Bxc6 and then target the e5-square, occupying it
with Ne5 and f2-f4. From there, our struggles are inscribed upon the pages of
the kingside, the arena in which we struggle for a direct attack on the enemy
king. Meanwhile, Black nurses ambitions on the queenside and hopes for a happy
future with his newly acquired bishop pair. Sometimes we are lucky enough to
inflict damage on Black's structure when he responds to Bxc6 with ...b7xc6. In
this case we are not obliged to attack and, instead, may play purely on his
damaged structure.} *

Some unpleasant things in life just don't go away, no matter how intensely we
ignore them. We must pause, reflect, and take our hats off to Sämisch for his
perseverance and his almost Churchillian refusal to resign, even though his

in this instance it feels like Black pushes the boundaries of reason. ---
QUESTION: Why did Black waste a tempo to force White to damage his structure?
--- ANSWER: Black seeks to enter a Sämisch Variation of the Nimzo-Indian in
reverse, which runs 1 d4 Nf6 2 c4 e6 3 Nc3 Bb4 4 a3. The line which is just
barely playable with White appears to me to be a very dubious idea played as
Black. I logically ask the question: why expend a tempo when White almost

cleared c4 for a knight, which pressures both e5 and d6. -- 3. It won't be so

A beautiful interpretation of the position and a plan which points at the very
essence of Black's weakness. Now White seizes control over e4, and Black's

tactic over the board. --- QUESTION: Isn't Black's resignation premature? ---
ANSWER: A bit premature, but Black is indeed busted. White controls e4 and c4,
his king is safe, whereas Black's is about to be attacked with g7-g6 next. I
suppose Black, probably discouraged, felt that in a losing battle submission
is sometimes the wisest course, if only to recoup energy for the next fight.
And in real life, Goliaths generally prevail over discouraged Davids. Over the
chess board, size does indeed matter. --- I remember once I had a pair of
bishops against my opponent's knights in an ending, when he unexpectedly
resigned. When I asked him why he resigned so early, he told me: "You out-rate
me by 500 points and I have better things to do with my time while you
out-technique me over the next three hours! I don't want to invest three hours
of my life in exchange for the 3% chance I have of drawing the game, so better
to quit while I'm ahead!" --- SUMMARY: Maybe a reversed Sämisch Nimzo-Indian
is playable from Black's side, but I remain sceptical about his chances and
feel that an early . ..a7-a6 simply hands White a tempo.} 1-0

1. Nf3 d5 2. e3 {QUESTION: - ? --- ANSWER: Admittedly, a bit cowardly, but my
student Varun had just won the 2008 American Open U2000 section with ease.
There are some chicken-hearted IMs who are intimidated by 11-year-old Experts!
What else can you expect from someone who meets 1 Nf3 c5 with 2 c3!, a pet
line which I cherish and praise lovingly in my Colle book? 2 e3 is perhaps not
the kind of move we normally associate with the Nimzo-Larsen, but we soon
enter familiar ground. --- QUESTION: Why did you use this odd move order? --- ANSWER:
At that time my opponent only played Queen's Gambit Tarrasch isolani lines as
Black against 1 d4, 1 c4 or 1 Nf3. So I knew he would play ...d7-d5 and ...c7-c5 and ...Nc6. My intent was to reach a reversed Nimzo-Indian, a tough
chore for a 10-year-old, since the positions tend to veer toward the strategic.

where it blocks the king's avenue of escape to the centre.} Be8 20. Rxh7 {

but if you face opponents (especially juniors, most of whom are hopelessly out
of their element in strategic games) who play ...d7-d5, ...c7-c5 and ...Nc6 in
all queen's pawn games, you can utilize this move order and trick them into
reversed Nimzo-Indian positions, with which they may well be unfamiliar, since
most expect some kind of QGD Tarrasch or Colle position.} 1-0

religiously, has a way of dampening creativity. The move is odd but, to be
fair, my opponent rarely enters such positions. Such is the wonderful
befuddlement power of 1 b3!. Perhaps he wanted to avoid a hanging pawns
position, mingled with a desire to escape the realm of familiar opening theory.

reversed Queen's Indian set-up. --- QUESTION: Can White extract an edge from
it? --- ANSWER: Probably not. The reversed London tends to be an equalizer. In
fact, the word "London" is virtually synonymous with the word "equal"! We
Nimzo-Larseners must earn our points the hard way: we must outplay and beat
our opponents from equal positions, through our superior understanding and
experience in the variation.} ({

Don't look so shocked. We should be accustomed to crazy g-pawn pushes by now!
As we all understand, GMs are genetically predisposed to such temporary
psychotic episodes when facing lower rated opposition. Kharlov, not exactly
acting in a companionable manner, bows before fate and stabs out with a move
which looks more emotional than logical. White's idea has the feel of improvisation, but who knows? It may actually be a plan churned out in Kharlov's home
laboratory. Objectively, this may be a fishy idea, but from a practical
standpoint, it is hard to turn down since it burdens Black with original
problems. White's g-pawn, cast adrift, has no way to return to its once safe
harbour. --- QUESTION: What is the point of White's random-looking move? ---
ANSWER: He hopes to construct a jigsaw puzzle comprised of two separate sets
of puzzles. The insurgency's intent is twofold: -- 1. White hopes to have time
for the disruptive h2-h4 and g4-g5. -- 2. Failing that, he can play Nf5, when ...Bxf5 and g4xf5 opens the g-file for his rook, as well as grabbing the
bishop pair.} Qd7 {The position is so alien that Black falls prey to an

Bxf5 $5 {With this move Black gives perhaps a bit too much credence to my idea.
In positions where you find yourself on the defensive, a conciliatory gesture
only tends to feed an opponent's belligerence. One of the hardest skills to
master in chess is the art of stoically absorbing the shock of a new idea from
your opponent. Black may have been better off keeping his light-squared bishop
on the board. He was understandably worried about both white knights hanging
around his king (even more so since this was a G/40 rapid game) and probably
reasoned that, if he allowed them to hover for too long, he risked a
combination which may blow him to smithereens;} ({for instance,} 21... Ne6 $4 {

multiple ambitions: -- 1. White owns the bishop pair in a semi-open position.

light squares around Black's king are weak, and in general across the board.}

But looking at it now, in a dispassionate light, I think White's mating
chances on the weakened kingside light squares clearly override this concern.
--- QUESTION: This plan looks really strong for White. Why on earth would you
reject it if you saw it? --- ANSWER: Over the board (and in life) every action
we engage in - even a non-action - communicates a player's motivation. In this
instance, White's non-doing speaks volumes. The disease of overcaution
resulted in indecision - and in this case, a non-decision. But in saying this,

you award a move an exclamation mark because it looks "fun"? --- ANSWER: Well,
don't you play chess for the fun of it, and the adventures which come along

moves like Jobava's last are actually commonplace! But think about the chaos
and confusion such ideas wreak upon your more orthodox opponents, when faced
with such alien plans. This fact alone means that 4 f3! gets an exclam! ---

more orthodox 4 Nf3 - ? --- ANSWER: A falsehood remains a falsehood, even if
centuries old, and it is human nature to regard that which is unfamiliar with
suspicion, but the fact is 4 f3! actually scores considerably better than 4

strategy.} ({Alternatively,} 5. f4 {turns the game into a Bird's Opening, but

QUESTION: Why this condition upon playing f2-f4 - ? --- ANSWER: I feel White
achieves a favourable Bird's after a very early ...c7-c6, since Black nearly
always needs ...c6-c5 later on, which means a tempo gain for White. We look at
this idea in Jobava-Ma Qun (Game 48) at the end of the chapter.}) 5... Bg6 {

with h2-h4, which invokes an ...h7-h6 or ...h7-h5 response from Black, which
in turn gives White future targets of attack. 2. Black's bishop may be

not the best one), then Black: -- 1. Frees his f8-bishop. -- 2. Clears d6 for
his pieces, especially his knight. -- 3. Disrupts and weakens White's pawns,
and he must be on guard to protect f5 from that point on.} 35. exd5 $6 ({

1. b3 Nf6 2. Bb2 g6 3. Bxf6 exf6 {. Black, believing he or she is about to
enter some form of King's Indian or Grünfeld, replies to our Nimzo-Larsen with
1...Nf6 and 2...g6. We, in turn, respond by chopping the f6-knight, in strange,
inverted Trompowsky fashion. Our plan: control over d5, starting with c2-c4,
Nc3, g2-g3 and Bg2. In this case, we get a better version than in a normal
Trompowsky. Why? Because after 1 d4 Nf6 2 Bg5 g6 3 Bxf6 exf6, Black's
counterplay fulcrum tends to revolve around the e4-square. He usually
continues with ...f6-f5, ...Bg7, ...0-0, ...Re8, ...d7-d6 and ...Nd7-f6. But
note that in our Nimzo-Larsen version, our d-pawn has been held back, so we
can play d2-d3, denying Black use of the all-important e4-square. This fine
point allows White to extract a strategic edge against Black's move order, and
we often see the door to Black's standard kingside counterplay slamming shut
with the sound of finality.} *

player, relishes opposite castling positions, and seeks to make a fight of it

statistics veer sharply toward White's cause. The contributing factors to
Black's future worries: -- 1. Open c-file. -- 2. Potential for a2-a3!,

1. b3 b5 {Talk about one-upmanship! Black decides upon symmetry plus one
square. --- QUESTION: Is Black's move playable? --- ANSWER: Sure, our opening
is so non-confrontational in the early stages that Black can get away with
almost anything. --- QUESTION: Black's b-pawn push to b5 looks like a stab at
nothingness. What is the idea behind it? --- ANSWER: Black reasons that he
will follow suit with a queenside fianchetto, but with his pawn pushed two
squares rather than one. This means extra space for Black, but also the
potential for weakness.} 2. e3 {

Here the game turns into a rather odd Zukertort Colle, with Black's pawn all
the way on b4. I have a feeling this version is slightly in White's favour.
--- QUESTION: How does Black's b4-pawn affect a typical Zukertort Colle. ---
ANSWER: This is a bit complicated. In a normal Zuke, Black sometimes adopts
the strategy ...c7-c5 and ...c5xd4, and if e3xd4, then ...d7-d6. When Black
later tosses in ...d6-d5, as he often does, White can't respond with c4-c5

indeed play c4-c5, creating a protected passer.} Nf6 7. Nbd2 Be7 ({After} 7...

QUESTION: Shouldn't you be criticizing Black's last move, which earned him
three potentially weak isolanis? --- ANSWER: He hopes to suture his wounded
pawns as best he can. It's a matter of priorities. Black considers White's

wing - even if it means taking on a potentially fatal weakness there.} 20. Rxa3

Counter in the centre when menaced on the wing, yet it somehow still smacks of
desperation, and feels like wasted penitence. I suppose Black noticed the
opposing forces insinuating, sneering and winking ever more boldly in his
king's direction, and decided he had to take action. But Houdini frowns on the
move, considering it misplaced optimism in a situation where grim resolve for

goes from exchange down to full rook down after} 36. Ra5 $1 {, when the rook
bullies his way down the narrow hallway, shoving all others aside. Black's

White's move and would have played it myself. But when you do, factor in a

much too slow for Black, but all I'm saying is be aware of such ideas so you
don't get caught by surprise. --- QUESTION: How would we respond if Black went
for that plan? --- ANSWER: We would beat him to it with Nc3-d5. The trouble

sudden fury and now given a sudden dose of human growth hormone. The weaker
force makes an incompetent invader. The black rook and white queen's
personalities clash, and it becomes apparent that the pair were never fated
for friendship. Now the incompatibility rises to a new level of open animosity.
So Black's rook rashly decides to hasten his enemy's departure with a swift
kick to her rear end. --- EXERCISE (combination alert): Black should be
summoning defenders to his king's urgent need, rather than making hostile
gestures. How did Korchnoi put his opponent away? --- ANSWER: Double attack

White, since it also blocks his fianchettoed bishop. If White later plays

scepticism of the eventuality of success behind this rather eccentric notion.

Nimzo-Larseners don't mind being lured into any kind opening anomaly. Our
philosophy: the weirder the better! --- QUESTION: What is Black up to here?
--- ANSWER: Black, if given time, may want some impregnable central set-up

fianchetto, trying to prove that the Nimzo-Larsen is a milquetoast opening for
