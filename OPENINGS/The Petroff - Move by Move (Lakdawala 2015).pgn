{This series provides an ideal platform to study chess openings. By
continually challenging the reader to answer probing questions throughout the
book, the Move by Move format greatly encourages the learning and practising
of vital skills just as much as the traditional assimilation of opening
knowledge. Carefully selected questions and answers are designed to keep you
actively involved and allow you to monitor your progress as you learn. This is
an excellent way to study any chess opening and at the same time improve your
general chess skills and knowledge. --- The Petroff Defence is a solid and
reliable way to meet 1 e4. It has a strong reputation and has been employed
regularly by many grandmasters, most notably former world champions Anatoly
Karpov and Vladimir Kramnik. By choosing counterattack instead of defence as
early as the second move, Black immediately avoids many favourite weapons for
White, including the Ruy Lopez, Italian Game, Scotch Game and a number of
daunting gambits. This practical advantage for those playing Black in the Open
Games cannot be underestimated. In this book, International Master Cyrus
Lakdawala invites you to join him in studying all the important lines in the
Petroff. Using illustrative games, he explains the main positional and
tactical ideas for both sides, provides answers to all the key questions and
tells you everything you need to know about successfully playing the Petroff
Defence.} 1. -- {Cyrus Lakdawala is an International Master, a former National
Open and American Open Champion, and a six-time State Champion. He has been

{Move by Move is a series of opening books which uses a question-and-answer
format. One of our main aims of the series is to replicate - as much as
possible - lessons between chess teachers and students. --- All the way
through, readers will be challenged to answer searching questions, to test
their skills in chess openings and indeed in other key aspects of the game.
It's our firm belief that practising your skills like this is an excellent way
to study chess openings, and to study chess in general. --- Many thanks go to
all those who have been kind enough to offer inspiration, advice and
assistance in the creation of Move by Move. We're really excited by this
series and hope that readers will share our enthusiasm.} 1. -- {John Emms,

{"Out of this nettle, danger, we pluck this flower, safety." - William
Shakespeare} 1. -- {Soldiers of ancient Rome, when on the defensive against
the Barbarian hoard, huddled into a tortoise-like defensive formation with
shields thrust outward to protect them from the incoming arrows and spears.
They called it the 'shield wall'. Petroff's Defence borrows this strategy. "I
hate the Petroff. It seems to me that Black only wants a draw, and he usually
has memorized long variations that bring him close to his goal. As (GM) Gufeld
would say, 'This is not chess!'" wrote IM Jack Peters to me in an email. The
name of our opening, to some, signifies stupefying boredom, but only to those
who don't relate to it. I remember throwing an anti-Petroff's/Berlin Lopez
tirade to some friends at the chess club about 15 years ago (your moody writer
throws many such rants on various subjects quite often, to all who are willing
to listen) about how "the Petroff's and Berlin Lopez are conspiring to ruin 1
e4?!, until the move is worked out to a forced draw". I raved on, adding that
Black's overly respectful interpretations were akin to playing a piano
concerto with just one finger, on a single key. Our opening is one of
cold-hearted - almost reptilian - pragmatism, where we begin the game with
deep deference to White's first move, with the humble objective to merely not
lose, rather than win. You may ask: why play in such fashion? --- A
Petroff-ignorant member of the San Diego Chess Club proclaimed the opening
boring and lacking in imagination. I innocently queried him, "You mean like a
person who names his dog, "Dog?" He proceeded to claim that defence of the
many '+=' positions can be as joyless as attending a funeral to which I
countered with "What if you attend the funeral of an enemy?" But this point of
view lacks perspective. In the Petroff's, we use our imagination, not so much
to wrest the initiative, but more to frustrate and neutralize White's first
move advantage and create an unbreachable defensive firewall. The overall goal
is not to energize our own positions, but instead, to suppress and deflate the
opponent's vitality - and most of all, his or her hopes of a full point. If
every opening has its own distinctive personality, then the Petroff's is one
of introverted humility. A chess opening is defined, not by its thrill-level,
but what we want from it. Activity? Solidity? Attacking or counterattacking
potential? In the case of the Petroff's, what we want most of all is to avoid
loss. We are willing to suffer 25 or so moves of an opponent's mild '+=' to
achieve it. We seek to create a self-sufficient barrier to White's ambitions.
Also, don't be fooled: Our drably inconspicuous opening can - and often does -
quickly erupt into chaos at a moment's notice. We may have the preference for
a quiet draw, but may well receive adventure, whether we like it or not. ---
When life deals us an unsavoury hand (i.e. the black pieces!) we have two
choices:} (1. -- {1. Rebel against reality by playing an ultra-sharp line.}) (
1. -- {2. Accept the reality and dig in solidly to attain equality in time.}) (
1. -- {Petroff's Defence - like the Berlin Ruy Lopez (which appears to be a
bit of an infringement of the Petroff-copyright, as the most difficult anti-e4
opening for White to crack), is an example of the latter choice, while
openings like Sicilian Najdorf and Dragon, ignore White's first move advantage
and go for the full point with increased chances of a loss. Those who live in
the hostile environments, like the Sicilian Dragon or Najdorf, the King's
Indian and King's Gambit et al., are inured to violence and expect it in
virtually every game they play. Petroff's is a different place, where our
opponent chases while we dance, just out of reach. When we win, it is almost
always because our opponent overpress.}) *

{Some openings, like the London System and Colle (considered by many as the
least adversarial openings in chessdom) are built for utility and thus
relatively easy to learn, the way a TV dinner is designed for the divorced man
who still hasn't learned to cook. The theory-intensive Petroff's Defence is
the absolute opposite. The opening is not conducive to those who study by
osmosis and blindly absorb theory by going over a large number of database
games. So unforgiving is Black's side that even a seemingly innocently subtle
variance in the position can bring immediate pain. Our lines are incredibly
involved, one looking similar to the other - yet requiring a different plan.
The knowledge and ideas from a chess book do not magically jump off the page
and into our minds permanently. We must go through the lines over and over
again for this to occur.} 1. -- {Through the magic of repetition, our brains
begin to construct highly specialized neural pathways, dedicated to
remembering even the most specific patterns. It is one thing to memorize our
lines, and quite another to distil the knowledge into a coherent middle game
plan. However, there is good news as well: one advantage of playing 2...Nf6
over the more traditional 2...Nc6 is that apart from skipping the heavily
analysed Ruy Lopez, we don't need to learn any of White's tricky gambits and
specialty sidelines, such as the Goring Gambit, the Danish Gambit, the Scotch
Game, the Max Lange Attack, et al.} *

{Any opening endorsed by a World Champion tends to elevate its brand. In the
case of Petroff's, we have towering advocates like Karpov, Kramnik and Anand,
as well as numerous super GMs. So I can wholeheartedly assure you that our
opening is sound! --- We must acquaint ourselves with the flora and fauna of
each opening we study, so here are the critical positions we meet in Petroff's
Defence:} 1. -- (1. -- {Cochrane Gambit: "Truth is beauty," wrote John Keats.
If we extend this to chess, then all semi-sound sacrifices and attacks are
ugly. I don't know if Keats took time out from his busy poetry schedule to
play chess, but if he did, he would most certainly have frowned upon the
presumptuousness of the Cochrane Gambit (Keats wrote an unfinished fairy tale -
the Cap and Bells, mentioning a Princess who "...castled her King with such a
vixen look"). White suffers from a selective interpretation, a preconceived
belief that he or she has a strong attack, ignoring the possibility that the
gambit is borderline unsound if Black knows the theory. White's sacrifice at
first glance feels so incomprehensible, that we suspect our opponent of
conduct of one playing some game other than chess, where material doesn't
matter. White refuses to pay even marginal homage to rationality, while
unabashedly embracing chaos. In today's comp-driven chess world, the sacrifice
is deemed semi-sound at best.}) *

{One warning to the reader: Petroff's isn't your best choice when you as Black
play for the win. If a water colour artist were to paint the mood of the next
two diagrams, she would do so with a limited palette of mainly grey tones. The
following two diagrams are examples of two very drawish lines White has at his
or her disposal:} 1. -- (1. Qe2 {In this annoying version, we are forced to
respond with ...Qe7, after which White forces queens off the board. However,
our position isn't quite an exact replica of White's since we are minus a move
in the symmetry and must play accurately to equalize.}) (1. d3 {Sometimes
counterfeiters try their luck by playing Petroff's from White's side, except a
move up. In this position White will play d3-d4 next, insisting upon an
Exchange French type of position when we respond with ...d6-d5, in the hopes
of reaching an intolerably dull version. If we are happy with a draw, then we
have no worries. If we have hopes for a win, the ritual of seemingly eternal
sameness can finally end if we play ...c7-c5 at some point and take on an
isolani.}) *

White has ditched his knight for the f7-pawn. This is a position loaded with
intriguing potential for both attacker and defender. At first glance, it feels

board, we face considerable practical difficulties, especially if White plays
the sacrifice in a rapid game. According to my database, White scores
respectably - just over 53%, so let's give the Cochrane some respect (even
though in our hearts we may still disrespect it!) and study it well.}) *

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nxe5 d6 4. Nxf7 {The opening salvo of the mean-spirited
Cochrane Gambit. I must take my hat off to both Short and Topalov in this
chapter, since they had the colossal nerve to play the gambit on world class
players. --- QUESTION: Surely it's unsound to hand over a full piece for
merely two pawns on the fourth move, against one of the most solid openings in
chess, isn't it? --- ANSWER: Will Black's king ford the river, or drown? At
this point it's hard to say. I agree that the sacrifice is semi-sound at best,
but from a practical standpoint, it's eminently dangerous, and the line
deserves its own chapter. It scores a respectable 53.1%, so clearly we must
factor in White's practical chances - especially if the sacrifice is played on
you in a rapid game, as in this one. There is no way to work out (at least
with our limited human brains) every permutation to such a speculative
sacrifice, but with the assistance of those wonderful/terrible comps, we can
come close. One can't shake the feeling that White unwisely declared war, when
lacking in manpower and armaments. --- QUESTION: Let's check if you have been
reading the introduction notes to the chapter. What does White get for the
piece? --- ANSWER: For the piece, White gets the following: 1. Two pawns,
since his kamikaze knight martyrs itself for the f7-pawn and he also gets to
hang on to the e4-one. --- 2. Black's castling has been disrupted and our king
remains in the centre for some time to come. --- 3. The loss of our f-pawn
means that White may eventually play for d2-d4, f2-f4 and e4-e5, sending our
f6-knight packing. --- 4. Bc4+ is in the air. We sometimes respond with ...Be6,
which means that after White swaps, our nervous king suddenly finds himself on

has three pawns for it, they look ineffective. Is he busted? --- ANSWER: The
position looks like something arising from a Ruy Lopez Marshall Gambit, where
Black often gets compensation for a missing pawn in the form of a
developmental lead and open lines to White's king. Here, however, Black is the
one up a piece for three pawns, while he still enjoys all the Marshall
Gambit-like benefits. Conclusion: White's opening has been an absolute
disaster.} 9. h3 ({After} 9. Nc3 a6 10. Bg5 Bf5 11. Re1 Nbd7 12. Bb3 {, M.Ganzer-K.Holschuh, correspondence 2003, White clearly lacks full compensation

so many people are willing to enter this semi-disreputable sacrifice. Why risk
all for a mere passing thrill? I suppose the answer is: When in pursuit of our
dreams, do we not all at times grow impervious to reason? Topalov thinks to
himself: "Let's play a semi-shady gambit on the world's leading authority on
Petroff's Defence" - not to mention a guy who was to become world champion the
following year.} Kxf7 {The knight's death is merely a tiny fragment of

drawing the game.} 5. Nc3 {QUESTION: What is White's idea behind White's move?

centre which doesn't yet exist. By holding back on d2-d4, White keeps us

followed by d2-d4, or even d2-d3 and f2-f4.} c5 {Given an exclamation mark by

exercise his authority by jealously hoarding the central and kingside light
squares, the underlying theme which saturates his coming moves. Kramnik
inoculates himself from future h2-h3, g2-g4 pawn storm ideas. The move does
weaken the g5-square, yet the move's virtues overrule this minor concession.
Kramnik's move has a dual purpose: 1. As mentioned, it seizes further control
over the kingside light squares. --- 2. Black prepares to develop his h8-rook,
via the h6-square. --- We sense a quality of stark simplicity in Kramnik's

which used to be just a surprise weapon, is now growing in popularity. ---
QUESTION: What is White's intent? --- ANSWER: White's reasoning for the move:
1. White creates a slight imbalance in the pawn structure, hoping the e5-point
may lead to a future kingside attack. --- 2. White doesn't want to lose time
capturing on e5 with his knight, only to get it booted off by d7-d6.} ({We

help White develop? --- ANSWER: If Black refuses to move his knight, then he

tells his brother, who in his entire life, has always followed one step behind.

works when we wrench loose reality and then attempt to force-fit it into our

responded with a move that previously only amateurs had employed," writes GM
Maxim Notkin. --- QUESTION: Wait a minute! Why is this line so rare for Black?

QUESTION: How does this alter the position from last game? --- ANSWER: White

undermine Black's knight, and this time, he does not have an easy way out with
...Nxc3. --- QUESTION: Does this mean that this line is inferior for Black
when compared with last game? --- ANSWER: I don't think so. Black's knight may
actually represent a strength more than a weakness, since he is the one who
seizes the initiative when White grabs the d5-pawn. The knight will be covered

its opposite, caution, can be carried too far. The king, casting about for a
potential escape route, hopes to remove himself from the unpleasantness with
ostentatious displeasure. Macieja plays a high-stakes gamble, hoping to win
with his extra piece. Have you ever made a very risky move and then inside
your head, jerk with shock, aghast at your own bravado? You feel like the meek,
tongue-tied office drone, who finally side-swipes and knocks down the arrogant

issues to resolve: 1. His king's safety in the centre of the board. --- 2. His
out-of-play a8-rook. --- In one move, Karpov intends to solve both issues, by
uniting the disconnected pair with a single idea: Step 1: Transfer his king
out of the danger zone, with ...Ke8 and ...Kf8. --- Step 2: Activate his

2: Deflection/removal of a key defender. White's most pessimistic fears are

childlike attempts to cling to power are refreshingly artless," comments the

Oreo cookie on the plate. --- SUMMARY: The risky 8...Qh4!? can be used as an
ambush weapon. At the club level, it may take your opponents completely by
surprise. I think Black's best line is 10...Qh3!, which leads to the
Mamedyarov-Kramnik note, rather than Karpov's riskier 10...Qg4!?, which may
even deserve a dubious mark.}) 0-1

the bishop pair, light squares and also take on a d4-isolani? --- ANSWER: All
true. At first glance, it feels as if White's strategic concessions fail to
even meet rudimentary standards of soundness. When we examine the position
deeper, we notice that White gets the following in return: 1. White gains a
development lead, since we used up three full moves in an open position to
pick off the d3-bishop. Our development lag is further aggravated by the fact
that our queen sits on the d5-square, which may lead to tempo loss with a
future Nc3 or Re5 from White. --- 2. The position is wide open, enhancing

QUESTION: Didn't White just lose a tempo, since he moved his bishop twice to
reach the e3-square? --- ANSWER: Well, it depends on whether you think Black's
...Rac8 is a useful move. I happen to think so, since it enables a future ...Na5 and ...c5. In any case, White's bishop, having 'lured' Black's rook to c8,
now retreats to e3 to bolster defence of the d4-pawn and enable c3-c4. There
is one other factor to White's decision: On the f4-square, White's bishop is
loose and vulnerable to future ...Qf5 tricks. The bishop is more securely
placed on the e3-square. This factor will become clearer in the notes to
White's 18th move.} Na5 {Threatening Nb3, while preventing c3-c4.} 18. c4 $5 {

position of slight inferiority. --- 2. He risks all by not fighting back in a
position of slight inferiority. --- So Anand decides to go with the former
choice, to spend his wealth, rather than horde it. Defending a slightly
inferior position is dreary work, similar to the unlucky soldier, assigned to
guard duty on a cold, rain-soaked night. A hidden anxiety presses down upon
Anand's mind, about the long-term weakness of his structure, so he gives away
a pawn in the hopes of activating his pieces. Still, I'm not sure Black should
give away this pawn.} ({I think he gains full equality with} 26... Rb8 $1 {

this presumptuous fool: I do not lose power simply because you don't believe

mysterious telepathic sensation, tends to have an exquisite sense of timing of
just when to rattle the position. So Black's bishop, weary of dealing with low
level functionaries, decides he needs access to the highest ranking white
official: the queen. --- EXERCISE: (critical decision): White puts out one
fire, only to see another blaze up in the middle of the board. What a
nightmare to have to calculate this with the clock running down! Kasparov's
choices: a) 43 Bxe4, accepting Black's piece offer. Now factor in 43...Qf1.
--- b) 43 Qa2, essentially ignoring the piece offer. --- c) 43 Qxe4, declining
Black's offer and offering a queen for his own attack. --- One line gives

new leader, and it's not White's queen, as she incorrectly believes. Hmm. This
move exudes the feel of overkill. If you see a lone spider in your home, there
is no need to fumigate and squish it. Just do one or the other, or better yet,
find a cup and put it outside in the yard. One senses that Kasparov is most
certainly not a man of sunny or equable temperament, and that neither
"tolerance" nor "compromise" are words used very often in his vocabulary. Time
pressure is that strange place where irrationality prevails (or at least gets
its way!) over its virtuous twin, logic. This is the worst of the three,
although White maybe can still build a fortress draw. Karpov writes: "At first
he simply wanted to take the bishop. He had 14 seconds left - he stretched out
his hand towards his bishop, but he did not touch it. An instant later his
hand hovered over the e4-square, while with his eyes he traced the path of my
queen from a6 to f1, and then he cast a glance at his knight. What is
surprising is that the black king is exposed, but it can be checked only from
one square - f5. Garry again looked at the position, then at the clock, on
which he had two seconds left, and - he captured my bishop with his queen!"} ({

the g6-square where it neutralizes White's powerful light-squared bishop. It
also reinforces the king's cover on the g-file, just in case White manages to
lift a queen to g4, or a rook to g3. This, in turn, keeps Black's king safer

{In this chapter, we cover White's numerous fifth-move dodges of the Old Main
Line. Some of them are bizarre, and clearly intended to throw us off
theoretically, like the following positions:} 1. -- (1. c4 {The idea here is
to cut off Black's natural ...d6-d5 (which it usually doesn't). White can even
follow with Nc3 and when we swap, play dxc3, with a position similar to the
games we see next chapter, but to my mind, an inferior version for White.}) (1.
Bd3 {This borrows an idea from the Kopec Sicilian. White inverts the normal
order and plays Bd3, blocking the d-pawn. The idea is to reach a normal
looking position with c2=c3, Bc2 and d2-d4 next.}) ({Then we must familiarize
ourselves with a couple of very drawish lines, neither of which pops up at us
with the force of a newly opened bottle of champagne.} 1. d3 {In this one,
White kicks our knight back and will play d3-d4 next, reaching a dull,
symmetrical line of the Exchange French, with White on the move. Neither this
line nor the next one can be accurately described as a cash cow for White.
Equality is not an issue. Winning with Black is, since White wilfully drains
the position of dynamism. If we are happy with a draw (as is really the goal
of our opening), then there are no worries.}) (1. Qe2 {A law in one nation can
be contradicted as a crime in another. This one is even more obnoxious. White
wants the symmetrical Exchange French line, but with queens off the board,
enhancing the position's drawing potential. --- In all cases, we are on
theoretically solid ground and not a single line gives us any real problem.}) *

move is quite dangerous for Black, while GM Konstantin Sakaev is dismissive of
the move and writes: "This is an original move, but that's about the most
positive thing that can be said about it." I think the move is dangerous only
if Black gets caught by surprise. Otherwise, I'm with Sakaev. --- QUESTION:
Why did White play c2-c4 rather than d2-d4? --- ANSWER: For a couple of
reasons: 1. By playing c2-c4 first, White inhibits ...d6-d5, a move which
normally helps support the e4-knight. --- 2. White may just skip d2-d4
altogether and play Nc3, allowing ...Nxc3 and dxc3, which is a structure
similar to the Nimzowitsch Variation, our next chapter in the book.} Nc6 {This

Isn't Black strategically lost with the burden of five isolanis? --- ANSWER:
Menace is that entity which is invisible and inaudible, yet tangibly real. Yet
here I don't see it for Black. I sense an arising of both hope and foreboding.
Davies thinks Black is in trouble, while I think Black is perfectly fine in
the coming ending, for the following reasons: 1. First, Black is up a pawn, so
it costs White time to win one back. --- 2. Black can set up a d5-outpost for
his rook with ...Rd5. --- 3. White's c5-pawn is fixed on the wrong colour of
White's remaining bishop, so Black is the one with the better bishop. If White
backs up the c5-pawn with b2-b4, then Black counters with ...a7-a5, which
reduces his isolani population. --- 4. Black's king can be easily centralized
by ...Rd5, ...Kd7, ...e6-e5 and ...Ke6. --- Now saying all this, I am reminded

choice for a player of Shirov's fiery temperament. The reason you don't see
any of my games in this book - unlike most of my other opening books - is that
some of my more grovely, cringing, snively opponents at the San Diego Chess
Club play ultra-drawish lines, like this one. In an email, I whined to editor
GM John Emms of the sad fact that Black really can't easily play Petroff for a
win if White is determined to draw, and he responded to those who play such
lines with a resounding "Cowards!!" proclamation. Be careful though. This line
actually contains a bite to it if we mishandle the defence, since we often
land in a queenless symmetry, two full moves down.} Qe7 {The only move which

{5 Nc3, a once obscure variation, was given new life in 2002 by Shirov at the
Russia vs. Rest of the World match, where he electrified the chess world with
wins in the 'harmless' line over GMs Morozevich and Motylev. So the 5 Nc3 line,
which was originally designed to dodge the theoretically nightmarish lines
covered in Chapters Two and Three in this book, soon soared in popularity. The
line, also called the Nimzowitsch Attack line of the Petroff (although it
should obviously be called the Shirov Variation), has had main line status
thrust upon it, mainly through the advocacy of most of the top players in the
world. In this chapter we have a split, where White develops his or her bishop
on either the e3- or f4-square. We need to understand the differences
thoroughly.} 1. -- {The position, which looks rather vacant right now, may
soon teem with hidden life unseen by the eye, like a desert landscape -
especially if Black decides to castle short and turn the game into an opposite
wings attack situation. Some of our overconfident opponents may believe that
psychological problems are merely symptoms of repressed desire, and therefore
remove all constraints of 'right' and 'wrong' by playing fast and loose with
their structure. They may do this by launching a kingside pawn storm with
h2-h4, f2-f3 and g2-g4. This can be intimidating at first, but let's not
equate lawlessness with freedom. White's future kingside pawn pushes can
easily morph into overextension later in the game if our opponents fail to
deliver mate.} *

Baramidze-Akobian, Antalya 2013, which was played just a few days after Wang

differences are: 1. By posting 7 Be3, White takes direct aim at the a7-pawn.
This can be important if Black decides to castle long, when the a7-pawn
becomes a target. --- 2. By posting 7 Be3, if Black castles kingside, it
clears the way for a kingside pawn storm plan with Nd4, h2-h4, f2-f3 and g2-g4.
If White's bishop were on the f4-square, it would tend to be in the path of
White's pawn storm. --- 3. By posting 7 Bf4, White discourages a future ...Ne5,
which can either lead to swaps, which White doesn't want, or ...Nxf3,
inflicting further damage to White's structure. --- 4. By posting 7 Bf4, White
is vulnerable to the above-mentioned tempo gaining plan ...Nd7-c5-e6. --- 5.

his rooks are misplaced in the centre.}) 12... Bxg5 13. Bxg5 f6 14. Be3 O-O-O {
QUESTION: Don't you think White has some winning chances with his bishop pair?
--- ANSWER: As mentioned above, my feeling is that White is hard-pressed to
prove that his bishop pair is meaningful in this close-to-symmetrical
structure. I feel like Black's drawing chances are far higher than White's
winning ones.} 15. Rhe1 Rhe8 16. b3 Bg4 {Wang Yue, perhaps secretly playing

behind his 20th move - is played with the philosophy: If you ask for nothing
from your position, then that is what you get. So Wang Yue decides that just
because the position is bland, this doesn't give his side license to think the
lethargic thought: "Any move will do". So he decides upon a risky, disruptive
idea to remove queens from the board. By altering the structure like this,
Black slightly enhances the latent power of White's bishop pair.} ({I would
have left matters alone and just shuffled about with} 22... Kb8 23. Bf2 Re8 {.}

tend to be habit-forming. When we make one, we crave the feeling so much, that
we want to make another. Black's last move is made under the theory: Every

QUESTION: In all the previous games, Black stalled castling as long as
possible to keep White in the dark as to our king's intent. Why does Black
castle so early in this case? --- ANSWER: Castling early is our feisty,
nuclear option. In this case Black refuses to play move-order games. We in
essence declare to our opponent: If you castle long, don't be so sure that it
will be Black's king who is the one to get mated! You can play this high risk
way if you don't mind chancing a loss to achieve greater chances to win.} 8.

This is Wang Hao's invention, which has taken off in popularity by the top GMs.

to the draw here when he still has chances? --- ANSWER: The decision to agree
to the draw was a self-inflicted wound, reminiscent of a sloppily swung hammer
over our soon-to-be bruised thumb. Chess is unmerciful in that if we misread
reality, then the interpretation's accompanying pain is certain to follow. I
remember a painful game where my clock ran low in a terribly complex position
and I agreed to a draw against a 2350 player. When I got home and put it on
the computer, it had me up +5.50, the equivalent of a full rook and more! I
simply didn't understand the position's most basic elements. --- SUMMARY:
Mikhalevski called Li Chao's early ...Ne5 and ...Nxf3 without kingside
castling "very interesting and requires many more practical tests" and my take
is that the resulting positions give rich play though Black has to be
defensively alert dealing with White's potential build-up on the half-open
g-file.} 1/2-1/2

QUESTION: In the first part of the chapter, we became acquainted with White's
problems with developing his bishop to the e3-square. Here, by placing the
bishop on the f4-square instead, he covers against the ...Nd7 and ...Ne5 ideas.
What is the downside of 7 Bf4? --- ANSWER: In the case of 7 Bf4, I see two
issues: 1. White may lose a tempo later if Black plays ...Nd7-c5-e6. --- 2. If
White plans a full-fledged kingside pawn storm, then his bishop may get in the
way as it will be hampering the movement of the f-pawn.} O-O {No move order
stalling this time. We just castle straight away. --- QUESTION: In the 7 Be3
half of the chapter, you emphasized the importance of Black stalling castling
as long as possible. Yet in the 7 Bf4 part, Black castles kingside and early
in every game. What has changed? --- ANSWER: My feeling is that Black's king
is safer on the kingside in the 7 Bf4 version, since he has access to more
central counters. For example: 1. Black will soon play ...Nd7 and ...Nc5,
which gives White central headaches, because ...Ne6 may gain a tempo. --- 2.
White has to watch out for ...Ne4 tricks, when his queen often lacks a safe,
stable square. Now this is a problem since White doesn't want to part with his
light-squared bishop as if he plays Bd3 to cover the e4-square, a ...Nd7-c5

{A typical attempt to sidestep the Petroff sees White bringing forth both his
knights in preparation for a Four Knights Game or Philidor's Defence.} 1. -- {
However, our last move 3...Bb4 challenges the assumption that White has
successfully evaded our attempts to play under a Petroff's banner, and the
position once again resumes its default state of our opening. White's best
line is to capture our e5-pawn and then play Nd3, which picks up the bishop
pair. Now this will probably offer your opponent a tiny edge - perhaps even
less than '+=' - with not much chance for our side to win. But if our overall
goal is to draw (remember, this is Petroff's!), then our line is very playable.
Another big advantage is that we don't need to learn either The Four Knights
or all its offshoots, like the Scotch Knights (3...Nc6 4 d4 exd4 5 Nxd4) and
Belgrade Gambit (3...Nc6 4 d4 exd4 5 Nd5). So from a practical view point, the
Three Knights Petroff is a time-saving choice.} *

short-term initiative tends to trump long-term issues, like opening the
position for the bishop pair, for one simple reason: If your initiative
develops to decisive proportions - as it did in this game - then there is no
'long term' for White, since the game is over!} 15. exf5 ({Most definitely not

QUESTION: Why is White playing so passively? --- ANSWER: White simply seeks to
play a reversed Ruy Lopez a move up from normal. He probably isn't after some
large opening advantage, but simply wants a position in which he feels
comfortable. I remember, after writing The Colle: Move by Move, reading a post
by a player who said he was disconcerted by the fact that I wasn't trying hard
enough to get White a '+=' advantage in every variation. The unfortunate fact
is: Some openings like Colle and London System are inherently even, and with
best play from Black, there is no true path to a clear advantage for White
from every variation. If a writer tells you there is, he or she is lying. I
still play them because I have decades-long experience in such structures and
count on outplaying my opponents later on in from an even position. So White,
in a sense is doing the same thing. He does not strive for an opening edge in
a position in which he feels comfortable with, and probably plays a move down
as Black. After} Nc6 {, we transpose to our game's position.}) 2... Nc6 3. Nc3

or turn and have it follow him. This move maybe deserves a dubious mark. White
seeks to implement a plan which is riddled with tribulation and lacks the
necessary essentials to build its foundation. He is clearly not playing for a
draw, despite the 650+ point differential in rating. Of course, the question
arises: why did the 2667-rated GM Sargissian allow a Petroff's on an opponent
rated around 2000? --- QUESTION: Why don't you like White's plan of opposite
wing attacks? --- ANSWER: A weakness is sewn into White's position, which will
be difficult to remove without tearing the fabric around his king: Black gains
time on the b3-bishop with ideas like ...b7-b5 and ...a7-a5. This forces White
to weaken his queenside structure further, meaning Black's attack will be
faster.} ({I would continue frugally with} 12. O-O {which leads to a typically

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nxe5 d6 4. Nf3 Nxe4 5. Nc3 Nxc3 {QUESTION: Doesn't this
game belong in Chapter Five?} 6. bxc3 {ANSWER: Not anymore. This time White
recaptures toward the centre. --- QUESTION: What are the differences? ---
ANSWER: 1. Unlike the 6 dxc3 lines, White's 6 bxc3 doesn't provide him with an
easy development lead and open central lines. --- 2. 6 bxc3 offers White a
central preponderance of pawns after d2-d4 is played. --- 3. White has an open
b-file for a rook. This means Black will not very tempted to castle long,
which in turn means that White knows our king's address: the kingside, and may
prepare to attack there. --- 4. 6 bxc3 is a bigger structural gamble for White
than in the 6 dxc3 lines. This means that if queens come off the board, White
may suffer in an ending. --- QUESTION: Do you believe the 6 bxc3 line is as
dangerous to Black as the 6 dxc3 variation? --- ANSWER: No. I think Black
equalizes without too much difficulty against the 6 bxc3 line, while we must
learn a huge number of lines against 6 dxc3.} Be7 7. d4 O-O {Unlike the 6 dxc3
lines where we may keep White guessing as to which side we castle, here our
choice is made clear. We must go kingside, since castling long would be
inadvisable, due to White's open b-file.} 8. Bd3 Bf6 {Black clears the e-file,
and keeps open a future possibility of a manual fianchetto with ...g7-g6 and ...Bg7 later on.} ({Black has no problems after} 8... Bg4 9. O-O Nd7 10. c4 c5
11. c3 Rc8 12. Bf4 {, T.Upton-M.Condie, Oxford 1984. With} Nb6 {, White must

O-O Bg4 10. Rb1 b6 {Black is forced to weaken his queenside light squares.} 11.
Re1 Nc6 {The knight can either be transferred to the kingside via the
e7-square, or play to the a5-square, followed by the ...c7-c5 pawn break.} 12.
Bf4 Re8 13. Re3 Ne7 ({The rook trade} 13... Rxe3 {follows the principle: Swaps
help the cramped side. But he probably avoided it because he didn't want to
allow the opening of the f-file after} 14. fxe3 Ne7 15. e4 Ng6 16. Bg3 Qe7 {
with a solid but passive position.}) 14. h3 Nd5 {This forces rooks off the
board.} (14... Bh5 {intending a future ...Bg6 is also about even.}) 15. Rxe8+

followed by Be4.} g6 18. Re1 Qf8 19. Be4 c6 20. c4 ({Infiltration with} 20. Qa6
{doesn't lead anywhere for White. After} Nc7 21. Qb7 Qd8 $1 {and if} 22. Bxc6
$6 Rb8 {, White is forced to give up his queen for rook, bishop and pawn after}
23. Qxb8 Qxb8 24. Bxd7 Qb7 {. White may have enough material for the queen,
but Black has all the winning chances, since the queen has access to many
white pawn targets in the future.}) 20... Nc7 21. d5 $5 {White grabs some
central space but at the cost of fixing his c4-pawn as a future target.} c5 ({
I like this better than} 21... cxd5 22. cxd5 {which gives White's pieces
access to the d4-square.}) 22. Qd3 Re8 23. g4 $5 {White, who clearly harbours
kingside ambitions, fumes with impatience and believes now is the time to
implement his kingside push.} ({However, after} 23. Qa3 a6 24. Qb3 b5 25. Ba5
Bd8 26. Bd3 Rxe1+ 27. Bxe1 Qe8 {, Black stands no worse anyway.}) 23... Bg7 24.
Nh4 $5 {Clearing the way for his f-pawn to move forward. When we prepare to
attack a well defended, weakness-free opponent, we are like one spider
attempting to trap a neighbourhood spider rival in our web. Odds are, it's not
going to work since the rival spider is well aware of our plans.} Re7 25. Qg3 {
This may be inaccurate.} (25. Ng2 {is safer and probably better.}) 25... Be5 ({
I prefer Black's game after} 25... Qe8 $1 26. f3 Be5 27. Bf4 b5 {.}) 26. f4 {
White continues to usher his kingside pawns forward. The attackers are only
half there, just partially formed shapes of demons seeking to enter Black's
realm of flesh-and-blood.} Bd4+ 27. Kh1 Qe8 28. Qg2 $4 {EXERCISE (combination
alert): We witness the classic overpress. --- Excess ambition impelled White
into taking an appalling risk to continue his attack. With his last move,
White volunteered himself into a deadly pin on the e-file. How did Black
refute the idea?} ({White stands only slightly worse after} 28. Bd3 b5 {.})
28... Bf6 $1 {ANSWER: Pin/Interference. --- The bishop reminds us of that
Twilight Zone episode where the ventriloquist's dummy attains sentience and
takes control over the act. This move probes his opponent's vulnerabilities
past the point of White's salvation. Now White's would-be attack vanishes.
This move forces White to weaken f5, which in turn allows ...Bf5.} ({ANSWER#2:
Also strong is} 28... Ba4 29. Bc1 Bf6 30. g5 Bc3 31. Re2 b5 32. Bd3 bxc4 33.
Bxc4 Rxe2 34. Qxe2 Qxe2 35. Bxe2 Nxd5 36. Bd1 Nb4 {and White can resign.}) 29.
g5 {When the damage has already been done and it's too late to take remedial
action, what else is there but to watch the enemy with a wary eye and be ready
when the inevitable strike occurs. This move is forced, but the trouble is it
opens the f5-square for a black pawn or bishop, which increases the pressure
on the pinned e4-bishop to unbearable levels.} Bd4 30. Kh2 Bf5 {Winning
material. All of White's joy was earmarked for his attack, and with its
absence, so goes his happiness.} ({Even stronger was} 30... f5 $1 31. gxf6 Bxf6
{when White's knight was unable to retreat. Nevertheless, after} 32. Nxg6 hxg6
33. Bxg6 Qf8 {, White lacks a good discovery and doesn't have compensation for
the piece.}) 31. Bxf5 Rxe1 32. Bd7 Bg1+ $1 33. Kg3 Qe2 {"A beautiful evening
gown and sparkling jewels cannot disguise and undo nature's handiwork,"
Black's beautiful queen rudely tells her homely g2-sister.} 34. Bxe1 Qxe1+ 35.

line is not as dangerous as its Chapter Five cousin, 6 dxc3.}) 0-1

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nxe5 d6 4. Nc4 {QUESTION: What is the point of playing
the knight to the c4-square? --- ANSWER: White plans to later transfer it to
the e3-square, where it watches over the f5-square, perhaps in conjunction
with attacking ideas like Qf3. --- QUESTION: Is it effective? --- ANSWER: I
think Kramnik's plan essentially neutralizes the idea by depriving White of
the f5-square. Still, it must be taken seriously since it has been tried on
players of the calibre of Carlsen and Morozevich.} Nxe4 5. Nc3 Nxc3 6. bxc3 {
White's main move.} (6. dxc3 {gets White into a version of Chapter Five, where
he wasted time with his knight. The following game is a good example of how to
play Black:} Be7 7. Bf4 Bg5 $1 {Black either gets a swap, or transfers his
bishop to a better diagonal.} 8. Qd2 Bxf4 9. Qxf4 O-O 10. O-O-O Nd7 11. Ne3 Qf6
12. Qg3 Nc5 13. Rd4 Re8 14. Rf4 Qg6 15. Qxg6 {and a draw was agreed. If anyone
is better, it is Black, A.Sokolov-J.Degraeve, Aix les Bains 2007.}) 6... g6 $1
{QUESTION: Why an exclamation mark? --- ANSWER: By fianchettoing on the
kingside, Black gets the following: 1. He makes his king safer. --- 2. White's
entire plan revolves around his playing Ne3 with the idea of Nf5. By playing ...g6, Black deprives White of his intent.} 7. d4 Bg7 8. Bd3 O-O 9. O-O Nd7 {
Kramnik prepares to eject White's knight with ...Nb6, while keeping his
c-pawn's options open for a ...c5-break, which challenges White's central
domination.} ({Also possible is} 9... Nc6 10. Rb1 Rb8 11. Qf3 Bd7 12. Ne3 b5 $1

White's centre.} 12. dxc5 dxc5 {The c3-pawn is now chronically weak.} 13. a4 $5
{A move made with the philosophy: When you have money, it's better to spend it
or give it away, because as the old saying goes: You can't take it with you.
Now the queenside begins to snarl with aggressive intent. A foe who doesn't
fear death is to his enemy, the most dangerous person in the world. Carlsen
decides he has had enough of this interminable adagio pace and decides to step
it up a notch. He buffs away the cosmetic flaws in his structure by giving
pawns away. This is in effect a two pawn offer for initiative.} Bd7 $5 {The
pool of distrust continues to rise between the two armies, both seeking to
strike first. Kramnik isn't a pawn grabber and prefers initiative to material
gain.} ({He probably feared White's initiative after} 13... Bxc3 $1 14. Rb1
Nxa4 {(the invasion of the pawn snatchers!)} 15. Nd5 Bg7 16. Bf4 {with a scary

White's initiative effectively with the forcing swap} Nc3 $1 17. Nxc3 Bxc3 18.
Be4 Qf6 19. Bxb7 Bxb7 20. Rxb7 Bd4 {and White's pawn-down position sags in
debility.}) 14. a5 Na4 15. Qxb7 Nxc3 16. Bd2 Be6 {Threat: ...c5-c4.} 17. Bxc3 {
A clear concession in the open position, but that c3-knight was just too
strong.} Bxc3 18. Ra4 Qd7 $1 {Kramnik forces an ending where only he has the
winning chances. He had the bad luck to face the world's premier endgame
specialist defending with the white pieces.} 19. Qxd7 Bxd7 20. Ra3 Bb4 21. Raa1
Bc6 22. a6 Rad8 23. Rfc1 {Threatening the cheapo c2-c3 which will trap the
dark-squared bishop.} Bc3 24. Rab1 Rfe8 25. Bb5 Re6 26. Bc4 {QUESTION: Doesn't
it follow principle to swap with Bxc6, eliminating Black's bishop pair? ---
ANSWER: Theoretically, yes. However, in this case there is a side issue: with
the swap of bishops, White's a6-pawn is chronically weakened.} ({Black would
eventually win a pawn after} 26. Bxc6 Rxc6 27. Rb5 Rd2 28. Nc4 Re2 29. Kf1 Re4
30. Ne3 Rxa6 31. Rxc5 Bd2 32. Rb1 Bxe3 33. fxe3 Rxe3 {with an extra pawn and
winning chances.}) 26... Re4 {A slightly inaccurate move which Carlsen soon
exploits.} ({Better is} 26... Red6 $1 {when Black has good chances to convert
with his bishop pair.}) 27. Rd1 Rxd1+ 28. Rxd1 Bd4 29. Bd5 $1 {Now White gets
away with the swap.} Bxd5 30. Nxd5 Re2 31. c3 $6 {White's follow-up is
inaccurate and now he must work hard to secure the draw. Apparently even
Carlsen's almost supernatural defensive/anticipatory abilities don't work 100%
of the time.} (31. Ne3 $1 {should hold the position. After} Bxe3 32. fxe3 Rxe3

chances to win.}) 41. Nc5 Re5 42. Nd7 Re3 {A double attack on the g3- and
c3-pawns. The trouble with this plan is Kramnik allows his passed a-pawn to

Black's shoulders.} Rxg3 44. Ne5 Kf6 ({After} 44... Re3 45. Rxf7+ (45. Nxf7 $4

game's outcome.} 47. Ke2 Bf4 48. c4 Re3+ 49. Kf1 Rc3 {The rook's plan is clear:
intercept and destroy. --- EXERCISE (planning): Snowfall may be a miracle for
someone who lives in the desert and an ordinary occurrence for another person
living in a Northern climate. Moral: One person's miracle is another's
everyday occurrence. Carlsen, who to my mind is currently the best defensive
and endgame player in the world, routinely saves a wretched position against
the world's best. It appears as if White is lost. Innocent targets tend to
beckon the wicked. After all, the c4-pawn is falling and the h4-pawn looks
sickly as well. How did Carlsen force a drawn position? --- ANSWER: Target
Black's only weak point: the g6-pawn and arrange a wrong-coloured remaining
bishop ending.} 50. Nh8 $1 {Threat: Rb6+ and Nxg6. A hidden strength -
unnoticeable to the eyes at the surface-level glance - enhances its power,
since a concealed weapon is so much more dangerous than one wielded openly by
the enemy. Carlsen's apparent negligence is proven illusory, as he divines the
source of his troubles and makes the appropriate repairs.} Rxc4 ({Miraculously,
