{This series provides an ideal platform to study chess openings. By
continually challenging the reader to answer probing questions throughout the
book, the Move by Move format greatly encourages the learning and practising
of vital skills just as much as the traditional assimilation of opening
knowledge. Carefully selected questions and answers are designed to keep you
actively involved and allow you to monitor your progress as you learn. This is
an excellent way to study any chess opening and at the same time improve your
general chess skills and knowledge. --- The Queen's Indian enjoys a deserved
reputation as a reliable opening choice for Black against 1 d4. Black's
opening system involves an early queenside fianchetto with the hypermodern
approach of controlling the centre with pieces, and the resulting positions
are rich in dynamic and strategic possibilities for both sides. The Queen's
Indian is a popular choice at all levels of chess, and many of the World's
top players have employed it as part of their opening repertoires. In this
book, International Master and chess coach Lorin D'Costa invites you to join
him in studying the Queen's Indian. He highlights the typical plans and
tactics for both sides, constructs a practical repertoire for Black and
provides answers to all the key questions.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 {

{Move by Move is a series of opening books which uses a question-and-answer
format. One of our main aims of the series is to replicate - as much as
possible - lessons between chess teachers and students. --- All the way
through, readers will be challenged to answer searching questions, to test
their skills in chess openings and indeed in other key aspects of the game.
It's our firm belief that practising your skills like this is an excellent way
to study chess openings, and to study chess in general.} 1. -- {Many thanks go
to all those who have been kind enough to offer inspiration, advice and
assistance in the creation of Move by Move. We're really excited by this
series and hope that readers will share our enthusiasm.} (1. -- {John Emms,

{The Queen's Indian Defence is characterized by the moves:} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6
3. Nf3 b6 {. --- It is important to note that the Queen's Indian is a sister
opening to the Nimzo-Indian Defence which occurs after 3 Nc3 Bb4, and for
details on the Nimzo I refer you to the excellent book on the subject by GM
John Emms in this Move By Move series. --- One of the key strategic ideas in
Queen's Indian (and the Nimzo-Indian) is the battle for the crucial e4- and
d5-squares. Much of the early play revolves around these squares and this
theme will recur throughout the book. So why does White play 3 Nf3, rather
than 3 Nc3 - ? With 3 Nf3, White plays an important developing move, avoids
the 3...Bb4 pin and retains the flexibility of playing Nb1-c3 later. Meanwhile,
Black's move 3...b6 prepares the development of the c8-bishop, either as a
fianchetto on the b7-square or sometimes, to the a6-square in order to attack
the c4-pawn. While Black has other 3rd move alternatives, such as 3...Bb4+ 
(the Bogo-Indian Defence), I personally prefer the Queen's Indian since pieces
are kept on the board and Black, in my view, has greater winning chances. For
us lower down the chess pyramid, we should be trying to play for a win with
both colours! --- As an introduction to the Queen's Indian Defence, in Chapter
One I have analysed five games by World Champions playing the opening from the
Black side.} 4. -- ({The main line over the years has been} 4. g3 {. White
intends to fianchetto his light-squared bishop, which from the g2-square
fights for the e4- and d5-squares and goes head-to-head with its counterpart
should Black's c8-bishop land on b7. I have decided, after much deliberation,
to go with} Ba6 {as my main line recommendation against the Fianchetto
Variation, but am demonstrating two relatively unexplored and much underrated
lines against 4 g3. Chapters Two, Three and Four see our discussion on that
topic.} ({Additionally, I felt that the reader should know something about} 
4... Bb7 {, so Chapter Five presents a sideline that you can surprise your
well prepared opponent with.})) ({The Petrosian Variation is introduced by} 4.
a3 {;}) ({or} 4. Nc3 Bb7 5. a3 {. By playing an early a2-a3, White prevents ...Bb4, thus keeping the c3-knight on the board to maximise influence over those
important e4- and d5-squares, and aiming to build a big pawn centre with e2-e4.
It was no less a player than the 13th World Champion, Garry Kasparov, who
championed this line from the 1980s onwards. We will be examining this
variation in detail in Chapters Six and Seven of this book. --- Chapters Eight
and Nine cover a number of less popular but respectable systems that White can
adopt to counter the Queen's Indian. Finally, Chapter Ten shows how a Queen's
Indian player can respond to Flank Openings such as the King's Indian Attack
and Réti.}) (4. -- {As a professional coach, I am always trying to extol the
virtues of really understanding what you are doing and the plans available,
rather than just learning rote moves. The Queen's Indian has many plans
available, to both sides, and by and large these tend to be of a positional
nature. This somewhat disappointed a friend of mine, I'll call him 'Dave' 
(rated around the 2000 mark) when I told him this, since he wants to attack at
all costs. However, to improve as a player I think it is important to
understand how to play positionally as well as aggressively. In addition, I am
not for one moment stating that you cannot attack in the Queen's Indian, with
either colour - a number of the games in this book involve both attacking
and sacrificial play. It is no coincidence that some of the world's most
aggressive attacking players have added the Queen's Indian to their opening
repertoires. --- By holding this book you have already taken the first step
towards adding the Queen's Indian to your armoury, and I hope that by reading
the notes and playing through the games you will be able to play this opening
confidently in your own games.}) (4. -- {Lorin D'Costa, London, October 2015})

here?} (5. a3 {is the subject of Chapter Seven. White commits the sin in this
game of simply playing 'moves' rather than playing with a purpose. This allows
the future World Champion Max Euwe time to build up an attack.}) 5... d5 $1 {
Even back nearly 100 years ago, Euwe knew the attacking set-up with ...d5 and ...Bd6 that I am recommending.} ({ANSWER: Black's ...c5 is a typical pawn thrust
to challenge the centre, but here it is not so good.} 5... c5 6. d5 $1 {

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. g3 {The 4 g3 variation is the main line
against the Queen's Indian Defence, and with good reason. Since Black is going
to challenge the e4- and d5-squares, White opts to post his bishop on g2 and
fight for these squares too. White delays the development of the b1-knight, as
this knight is waiting to see where the f8-bishop decides to go.} Ba6 {This is
the move I am going to recommend as our main line against the 4 g3 systems.
--- QUESTION: Why play 4...Ba6 - ? The c4-pawn can surely be defended easily.
Didn't you say the d5- and e4-squares are more important and therefore 4...Bb7
should be played? --- ANSWER: Actually the c4-pawn is a key target for Black
in the Queen's Indian (as well in the Nimzo-Indian), and defending this pawn
is likely to lead to a compromise in piece or pawn placement. Often the bishop
returns to the b7-square at some point, having done its dirty work on a6. ---

one nonetheless. It prevents Black's bishop from coming to b4 and so in some

point of this? --- ANSWER: This odd looking move serves to counter White's
idea mentioned in the previous note. The threat of ...Na5 almost forces White

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. g3 Ba6 5. Qc2 {Like many chess opening
variations, this line has gone in and out of fashion over time. The 5 Qc2
variation has certainly hit the heights in recent years with the new idea of a
pawn sacrifice on d5, as we will see in this game. In general, 5 Qc2 feels
quite natural - Black has played ...Ba6 to try and encourage White to
compromise on piece placement to defend c4, but Qd1-c2 is a typical move to
try and put pressure on the important e4-square. Of course, if Black were able
to play ...c5 and ...Rc8 quite soon, the queen might be exposed. It is
precisely for this reason that we see White go on the offensive at an early
stage, as a slower game would not benefit him with the queen placed like this.}
Bb7 {QUESTION: Why did we lose time by playing ...Ba6 then back to b7,
especially if queen to c2 is a move White might want to play? --- ANSWER:
White may have control over the e4-square, but he has loosened himself on the
other important central square, d5. This will become apparent in a moment.} 6.
Bg2 c5 7. d5 $1 {In my opinion, the most testing move for Black to face.} ({
All other variations give Black a comfortable game. For example: a)} 7. dxc5
Bxc5 8. O-O a6 9. a3 Be7 10. Nbd2 Qc7 11. b4 d6 12. Bb2 Nbd7 13. Rac1 Rc8 14.
Qb1 O-O {, with a completely acceptable Hedgehog position for Black, was F.Bersoult-L.D'Costa, Dieppe 2009. In these Hedgehog positions, Black waits for
a chance to strike out with a ...b5 or ...d5 pawn break, and Black's set-up is
difficult for White to break down. In my opinion, it is a good line to play
against both stronger and weaker players. The Hedgehog is both solid and gives
chances to play for a win, since most of the pieces remain on the board.}) ({b)
} 7. O-O cxd4 8. Nxd4 Bxg2 9. Kxg2 {and now Black should post the queen on b7,
via c7 or c8; for example,} Qc7 10. Qd3 a6 11. Nc3 Be7 12. e4 O-O 13. f3 Rc8
14. Na4 Nc6 15. b3 Ne5 16. Qe2 Qb7 17. Be3 d6 {was played in D.Elizarov-A.Lastin, Belorechensk 2010. In general, Black should not be worried about the
trade of the light-squared bishops. He has a good Hedgehog position, can fight
for ...d5 or ...b5, and if the position should ever open up then the white
king on g2 might feel a bit draughty.}) ({c)} 7. e3 cxd4 8. exd4 d5 9. O-O dxc4

2007.}) 7... exd5 8. cxd5 Nxd5 {QUESTION: On what grounds can White justify
this pawn sacrifice? --- ANSWER: White gains a lead in development, and there
are now always tactics in the air on the h1-a8 diagonal that Black needs to
monitor. The semi-open d-file is also a cause for concern, as White can post a
rook on d1 very quickly and apply some pressure. Even if Black consolidates,
it can be difficult to utilise the extra d-pawn, as White often plays e2-e4
and tries to clamp down on the d5-square. However, a pawn is a pawn, and a
central one at that! If Black does weather the storm, he can certainly play
for a win. This is why I am recommending snatching the pawn with 8...Nxd5.} ({

seen in the following example:} 8... Bxd5 9. Nc3 Bc6 10. e4 d6 11. Bf4 Nh5 12.

Black must already tread carefully. Threats are now appearing on d5 and
therefore indirectly on b7 and d7 also.} Nc6 {An important tabiya for this
variation. Apart from 11 Qf5, White has 11 a3 and 11 Qa4 which are examined in
the following two games.} 11. Qf5 (11. Rxd5 $4 Nb4 {was the trick justifying

this are common in this variation.}) 11... Nf6 12. e4 g6 {QUESTION: Why are we

exchange on the b4-square, there is the potential for ...a5-a4 to prise open
the queenside to Black's advantage - another reason why tempting b2-b3 was
advantageous. Whilst both sides jostle for the e4- and d5-squares (and in
particular White will try and get in e2-e4 at some point) Black has pawn
breaks of his own. ...c7-c5 is usually the first one to consider, and also ...d7-d5 to play in classical fashion. Finally ...e6-e5 may be possible, if
preparations can be made for that advance. In general, the Queen's Indian

seems a little odd! You haven't mentioned this move before as a way to attack
the centre. --- ANSWER: This move unbalances the position early and is a good
way to play for a win. If you want something more solid, Chapter Three is the
way to go. However, such an approach may not always work against an opponent
who is willing to sit tight. Here, Black immediately offers to exchange the
b-pawn for the more central c-pawn. The argument is that the loss of time is
not so crucial given that the centre is quite closed. If the c- and b-pawns
are exchanged, as they are in some lines, then Black can even go for an early ...a5-a4 (as also sometimes happened in Chapter Three) to instigate early play
on the queenside. Care is need here though, in case the centre gets opened up
and Black's lack of development ever gets highlighted.} 6. -- ({The material

the centre also with e2-e4 at the right moment. All of that adds up to pretty

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. g3 Bb7 {Here we investigate the classical way
to play with 4...Bb7. Instead of bothering with the nuances of getting White
to play b2-b3 as we saw in previous chapters, simple development will be the
priority.} 5. Bg2 g6 {Again I am going for something offbeat and a path less
trodden. The idea of posting the bishop on the g7-square (instead of the usual
e7-square), is that in many Queen's Indian lines Black plays ...Ne4 and
eventually ...Bf8-e7-f6 to attack White's centre. By immediately playing the
kingside fianchetto, it could be argued that this saves time over that plan.
With the typical Queen's Indian 'cat and mouse' being played between the
b1-knight and f8-bishop, Black decides that since White doesn't threaten e2-e4
any time soon, he can put the bishop on a safer square. Another plan for White
is to advance d4-d5 early and seize space. Whilst that attempts to block out
the b7-bishop, it opens up the h8-a1 diagonal for its partner in crime on g7.
Consequently there are an abundance of tactics based on that theme which we
will encounter. It should however be noted that the worst case scenario is
that White plays d4-d5, Black obtains no counterplay and gets squashed when
e4-e5 arrives afterwards. Try not to let that happen!} 6. -- ({From the
current position, White has various ways to fight for the centre. The
immediate push} 6. Nc3 Bg7 7. d5 {is the subject of Games 27-28, while in Game

develops his b1-knight with Nb1-c3.}) ({If White castles on move 6, then after

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 4. a3 Ba6 {It was Tigran Petrosian, the ninth
World Champion, who first recommended the move 4 a3 as a way to combat the
Queen's Indian Defence. However, it was only when Garry Kasparov started
playing it in the early 1980s that the variation was really put on the map.
Not only because one of the best players in the world was reinvigorating the
line with plenty of new ideas, but also the results. Kasparov built up a huge
record with the line, and was winning games in style to boot. Subsequently,
players of the Queen's Indian had to find antidotes to the aggressive lines
Kasparov was playing. I hope this chapter will demonstrate some of those to
allay your fears that this is some kind of 'winning variation'! --- What is
the idea behind this little pawn move? It prevents the f8-bishop coming to the
b4-square, which means the b1-knight can come to c3 with impunity. Since we
know this knight covers the key e4- and d5-squares, it can therefore be argued
that 4 a3 helps control the centre. The drawback is that such a pawn move at
this early stage of the game does nothing to aid development and can be
considered rather extravagant. Chess surely cannot be so simple that the so
called advantages listed above about 4 a3 mean White gets a winning game? Like
the winds of fashion in chess in general, new lines come and go. Whilst this
line is still played by top players, the dangerous ideas that Kasparov
introduced haven't had the same effect in recent years. Study this line
carefully, and you should be fine! --- In this chapter we cover my repertoire
recommendation 4...Ba6.} (4... Bb7 {is also a reputable main line, and in fact
will usually transpose to the line covered in the next chapter after} 5. Nc3 {

this chapter with Game 35 which is a classic Kasparov game in this line.}) 5.

everything to gain by pushing on!} 12. Ke2 Be7 {I will label this 'the sort of

obliges Black to develop his light-squared bishop on b7.} Bb7 (4... Ba6 {
makes no sense here, as White could simply occupy the centre with} 5. e4 {.}) (
{Meanwhile} 4... Bb4 {transposes to the Nimzo-Indian, so 4...Bb7 is Black's
main move if he wants to stay within Queen's Indian territory.}) 5. a3 {
With this move, White enters the Petrosian Variation, having prompted Black to
play 4...Bb7. Of course this position could also be reached after 4 a3 Bb7. In
the previous chapter we examined 4 a3 Ba6, and I believe that system is
completely viable and solid. However, to broaden your horizons on the Queen's
Indian and the variety of pawn structures on offer, it is a good idea to be
familiar with more than one main line chosen by Grandmasters at the highest
level. This gives you a choice but more importantly, these games highlight the
instructive Queen's Indian middlegames that arise and so they are certainly
worth taking a look at. Black must understand what he is doing here, as he can
be steamrollered very fast if he doesn't play carefully.} d5 {This is the key
move to play here for Black. Black argues that 5 a3 was not the most useful
move and thus a transposition to a Queen's Gambit Declined (QGD) structure is
the way to go. Note that the other typical move ...c5 transposes to a Benoni
structure after d4-d5. This is not a pawn sacrifice (as in similar situations
where the White queen is on the c2-square) because the queen is still on d1
and defends the d-pawn. If you are willing to play a QGD type of set-up, and
wish for a line a little more solid, then 5...d5 should probably be your
weapon of choice.} ({In Game 46, we look at what happens if Black doesn't
occupy the centre but continues development with} 5... Be7 $6 {which is
answered by} 6. d5 $1 {.}) ({The remaining games in the chapter examine} 5...

the f8-bishop cannot go to b4 or any other decent square on this turn. However,
it fails to meet the demands of the position - it is crucial that Black
occupies the centre with a pawn on the 5th move, for reasons this game will
demonstrate.} 6. d5 $1 {QUESTION: What is the reasoning behind this? ---
ANSWER: Just watch the game and you will see! We know the e4- and d5-squares

building up a huge centre? This game is a lesson on how to use that central

QUESTION: You mentioned pawn structures in the introduction, and I see Black

Normally such a pawn can become weak if all the minor pieces are exchanged off,

d-pawn can be quite strong if it is mobile and able to advance quickly. How

It is important to understand what the various plans are for each side within
the Hedgehog set-up. White will play primarily on the queenside, and look to
break with c4-c5 and open up the position at some moment. For Black, the key
is to try and go for ...d5 and ...b5 to open up the position in his favour,
though the Maroczy Bind structure with the pawns on c4 and e4 are designed to
try and prevent this. Often a game of cat and mouse takes place over the
following 10 moves or so, with both sides jostling to prevent their opponent's
plan whilst simultaneously getting their own plan in. I find this a great way
to play for a win though, since most of the pieces remain on the board. --- A
final plan I should mention, whilst much rarer, is the idea that Black can in
fact play for a kingside attack with ...Kh8, ...Rg8 and ...g5-g4. This looks
risky, but if timed correctly, can be very effective. Generally this occurs
when White moves around aimlessly and demonstrates no active plan.} 17. Qd2 Bd8

his hand with a kingside fianchetto, Black's light-squared bishop is minor
piece that Black wants to be posted on the e4-square. Then it can fight with

1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 b6 {There are some other, lesser played variations
which are worth seeing in case you encounter them. By eschewing the main lines
from the earlier chapters of this book, White is hoping to catch the second
player off guard. Hopefully by now you will have a fair idea of how Black
should be playing in the Queen's Indian, and these methods are usually the
same against the other moves (which is a major advantage of this opening). ...c5 and ...d5 are moves we have always considered, and they generally work well
here too. In my view, only 4 e3 (Games 59-64) is any sort of serious test,
though strong players have used 4 Bf4 (Game 65) and so that should be examined
as well.} 4. e3 {This variation can contain more poison than it first appears.
White has a simple plan of Bf1-d3 and 0-0 to develop quickly, and often
follows with b2-b3 and Bb2 for a Colle-Zukertort type of position. In essence,
White is trying to avoid sharp theory and instead heads for simple piece
development. Rather than going for the aggressive e2-e4 break which we know is
White's overall aim in the Queen's Indian, there is nothing fundamentally
wrong with this more restrained way of playing. From Black's point of view, do
not be lulled into thinking there is no harm to be done here. For those not
familiar with the Colle-Zukertort style of play, it is all about the kingside
attack. Both white bishops on b2 and d3 point towards the castled black king,
and they might even be willing to sacrifice themselves on the h7- and
g7-squares if the opportunity ever crops up. Otherwise, they will be adequate
backup for a piece attack towards h7 or g7.} Bb7 5. -- ({After} 5. Bd3 {
, Black has three major options, namely} Bb4+ {(Games 59-60),} (5... d5 {
(Games 61-62)}) ({and} 5... c5 {(Game 63).})) ({Finally, the rare move} 5. Nbd2

was how the game actually started.}) 5. Bd3 Bb4+ {QUESTION: Don't we normally
wait with this move, since the b1-knight has not committed itself to the
c3-square? --- ANSWER: In the 4 e3 variation, White often plays b2-b3 and
Bc1-b2, and the b1-knight is actually quite flexible in that it can go to
either of the usual squares on d2 and c3. This 5...Bb4+ move, however, throws
a mini spanner in the works, as 6 Nc3 immediately transposes to the
Nimzo-Indian Rubinstein Variation, so if White wants to keep a Queen's Indian
flavour to the position, he should block on d2.} 6. Bd2 (6. Nbd2 {is examined

recommend something with a few more winning chances for Black. We have
encountered a few examples in this book already where Black can exchange on
the d2-square without too many problems, but to play for more it is advisable
to keep as many pieces on as possible.}) 7. Nc3 {EXERCISE: White might be
going e3-e4 next. Which pawn break in the centre should Black go for: a) 7...c5 or b) 7...d5 - ? --- ANSWER: Both are good, since the bishops on d3 and d2
block the White queen's influence on the d-file. This means that the d4-d5
push won't have such a great effect.} c5 {In general, I like ...c5 if White
cannot successfully meet this with d4-d5. This is one reason why forcing the
White bishop to the d2-square is a positive for Black. It is clear this bishop
would rather be on c1, where it can go to b2 and influence the centre from
there.} (7... d5 {, and going to the centre with the other pawn, is quite

for Black, and the queenside is hardly something to be considered given the
lack of pawn protection on that side.}) 8... bxc5 (8... Bxc5 {was also fine,

{In this final chapter, we will examine how the Queen's Indian set-up with ...b6 can be employed against a variety of other lines, including the King's
Indian Attack and Réti systems. These variations delay or completely omit the
d2-d4 pawn move, but both do involve a kingside fianchetto with White's
light-squared bishop coming to the g2-square very early on. The main idea of
delaying the d2-d4 move is that Black no longer has the e4-square as a launch
pad for either the f6-knight or the b7-bishop. This is because the move d2-d3
can always be played. Of course, the drawback is that White is no longer going
for early active operations in the centre, using ideas like d4-d5 which we
have encountered earlier in this book. Essentially, with these systems, White
is going for a slower build-up, which can catch the second player unawares if
he assumes White is up to nothing.} 1. Nf3 Nf6 2. -- ({After} 2. g3 b6 {
, Game 66 is an example of a King's Indian Attack set-up with an early d2-d3
for White, countered by an early ...e6 and a Hedgehog structure for Black. ---
In the remaining games I cover the double-fianchetto approach, where Black
plays both ...b6 and ...g6. This can often transpose to Chapter Five should
White play an early d2-d4 and Black also plays an early ...e6. Game 67 shows
how Black could benefit by saving a tempo by refraining from ...e6 in this
scenario.}) ({Finally, Games 68-69 cover the line} 2. c4 b6 3. g3 c5 4. Bg2 Bb7

{An understated move that is designed to slow down the d4 pawn break, as then
the c4-pawn will be hanging at the end of it.} 11. Qd2 Nd7 12. b3 Nde5 13. Ne1
Nd4 14. Rb1 f5 {I really like Black's strategy in this game. Deny the opponent
the d3-d4 pawn break and then go for play yourself.} 15. f4 Nec6 16. Ne2 Rc7
17. Kh2 e5 {The computer only thinks Black is ever so slightly better, but
this is a tricky position for White to play. He doesn't have a plan and Black
is far better coordinated.} 18. exf5 Nxf5 19. Bg1 Ncd4 20. Bxb7 Rxb7 {The
white king is weakened further with this exchange of bishops.} 21. Nxd4 cxd4
22. Ng2 Rbf7 23. Bf2 Bh6 {White's position starts to creak at the seams.} 24.

initiative.}) 31... gxf4 32. Qxf4 Qa3 33. Qg4 Qxd3 34. Bxd4 {An attempt to
complicate matters, which is easily rebuffed.} h5 $1 35. Qg6 Qxe4 {. In my
view a classy game from Planinc who demonstrated how to handle Black's set-up.}

11. Rac1 a6 12. b3 O-O 13. Qh4 Rc7 {QUESTION: What is the point of this move?
--- ANSWER: It is a multi-purpose move that allows the idea of ...Qa8 and ...Rfc8. This in turn helps Black to get in one of the ...d5 or ...b5 pawn breaks.
Clearly Black will be getting on with queenside play, although White's ideas
of Be3-h6 and Nf3-g5 also have to be contended with.} 14. Bh3 Qb8 15. Bh6 b5 $1
{Well timed. The c3-knight, no longer defended by a pawn on b2, will look a
little shaky.} 16. Bxg7 (16. cxb5 Bxf3 17. exf3 Ne5 18. Bg2 Rfc8 {followed by ...axb5 is better for Black, both in the pawn structure and relative activity of
the pieces.}) 16... Kxg7 17. Nd5 {EXERCISE: Should Black take on d5 with the
knight or bishop? --- ANSWER: Black needs to avoid his b7-bishop being locked
out of play, as it has little scope along the a8-h1 diagonal should Black play
17...Nxd5 and White answers with 18 cxd5. So 17...Bxd5 is the most
straightforward solution, although it turns out that 17...Nxd5 is also good if
Black follows up correctly (see the next note).} Bxd5 (17... Nxd5 18. cxd5 Nf6

from c6 in any case.}) 21... Qxc8 {The white pieces look stranded on the
kingside as Black's queen eyes the c-file as an avenue to start harvesting
pawns.} 22. Qg5 Qc2 23. Bxd7 (23. Qd2 Qb1+ 24. Kg2 Nc5 {and the h3-bishop is
practically useless here, and the a2- and d5-pawns are prime targets of attack
for Black.}) 23... Qxe2 $1 24. Bg4 h5 {Regaining the piece, and maintaining
