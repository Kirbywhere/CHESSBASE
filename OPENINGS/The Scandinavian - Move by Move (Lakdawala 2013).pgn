{This series provides an ideal platform to study chess openings. By
continually challenging the reader to answer probing questions throughout the
book, the Move by Move format greatly encourages the learning and practising
of vital skills just as much as the traditional assimilation of opening
knowledge. Carefully selected questions and answers are designed to keep you
actively involved and allow you to monitor your progress as you learn. This is
an excellent way to study any chess opening and at the same time improve your
general chess skills and knowledge.} 1. e4 d5 {. In this book, International
Master Cyrus Lakdawala invites you to join him in studying the Scandinavian
Defence. In recent years this opening has become a very popular choice for
club and tournament players. Lakdawala focuses on the modern lines with 3...Qd6 - an approach championed by grandmasters and Scandinavian experts such as
Sergei Tiviakov. Lakdawala outlines a reliable repertoire for Black, examines
the major positional and tactical ideas, answers all the key questions and
tells you everything you need to know about playing the Scandinavian.} (1... --

{The 'Move by Move' format is designed to be interactive, and is based on
questions asked by both teachers and students. It aims - as much as possible -
to replicate chess lessons. All the way through, readers will be challenged to
answer searching questions and to complete exercises, to test their skills in
key aspects of the game. It's our firm belief that practising your skills like
this is an excellent way to study chess.} 1. -- {Many thanks go to all those
who have been kind enough to offer inspiration, advice and assistance in the
creation of Move by Move. We're really excited by this series and hope that
readers will share our enthusiasm.} (1. -- {John Emms, Everyman Chess}) *

{My happy association with the Scandinavian began in the mid 1980's (it comes
as quite a shock to suddenly realize you have been playing an opening since
Ronald Reagan's presidency). I was paired with the black pieces against the
monster 2600-rated IM, and friend, Doug Root, who I trailed in the tournament
standings by a half point and rating wise by over 100 points. I had never
beaten him, and my two defences, French and Alekhine's, felt woefully
inadequate. He opened the game with} 1. e4 {. Then a Cat Stevens song (before
he became Yusuf Islam!) suddenly popped into my head: "I'm looking for a hard
headed woman, one that will make me do my best. And when I find my hard headed
woman, I know the rest of my life will be blessed, oh yes, yes it will!" ---
So based on this intuitive data alone, as if by its own volition, my right
hand impulsively reached out for my d-pawn and to my horror pushed it two
squares, and soon my hard headed woman emerged on} d5 {(and yes, I realize
that by making this confession, you now regard your writer as slightly
unbalanced). --- The only Scandinavian game I was familiar with was Larsen's
masterpiece (a 3...Qa5 Scandi) against Karpov played in Montreal, 1979. In an
unbelievably good stroke of fortune, Doug chose the same line as Karpov (the
single variation I knew), and overextended, much the same as Karpov did
against Larsen. Well, I was hooked. But the question arose: How did I arrive
in the situation where good fortune bubbled over? Was it dumb luck, or was the
Scandinavian a better opening than people give it credit for? I chose to
believe the latter. I didn't care that at the time (and even today) many
strong players considered the Scandinavian borderline sound. In fact, the late
GM Rosendo Balinas, after beating down my Scandi, scolded me: "Your first move
was an error!" He warned me that Black's early queen excursion walked that
precarious tightrope between reason and irrationality. I didn't believe him
then and I don't know.} *

{A Violation of all that is Sacred:} 1. -- {With the Scandinavian, we issue a
flagrant challenge to long established doctrine. Our charmed opening mockingly
blasphemes against the sacred verities of the most holy of principles and we
must learn to live with a stigma attached. After all, in playing our second
and third moves, ...Qxd5 and ...Qd6, Black violates no less than two
principles:} (1. -- {1. Don't bring your queen out early, since your
opponent's pieces or pawns may give chase, at your loss of time and discomfort.
}) (1. -- {2. Don't fall behind in development.}) (1. -- {However, normal laws
of physics collapse when entering this anomalous pocket of space. In this
universe, rapid development and central control are arbitrarily punished,
while egregious violations like bringing out one's queen early, and moving her
over and over again, is blessed with reward! The Scandinavian is a dark alien
technology, which doesn't function under any set of mechanical principles with
which I am familiar. It's a bit like the hard-working government clerk who
finishes his work early, and as a consequence must complete the unfinished
work of lazy co-workers. Well, we are the lazy co-workers! The reasons? ---
First, White has a terrible time opening the position any further, since our
Caro-Kann set-up: ...c6, ...Bf5 (or ...Bg4), and ...e6 renders the structure
rather rigid, which in turn deflates White's much publicized development lead.
--- Secondly, your opponent lacks specific targets, despite an often massive
development lead. --- Lastly, your opponent often believes you are crushed,
when in reality he or she may only hold only a mild '+=' or even '='
assessment.}) (1. -- {From my experience our opening represents an agency
unconstrained by normal chess laws, and we, the faithful, are inexplicably
granted amnesty for past, unpunished (and future) crimes, in perpetuity.
Ironically, it is precisely our flagrant and defiant violations which plant
the seed for the defeat of our law abiding opponent. Our secret? We drizzle
temptation before our opponent's eyes. It is in his extravagant attempt to
bring us to justice - that very moment is normally when our opponent's guard
finds itself at its lowest ebb - and it is precisely then that we counter
strike, and White finds his rage channelled into diversionary byways. --- Have
faith. Our opening is sound. At the time of writing, Black scores just above
46% after 3...Qd6 - slightly above average for a black opening. So the stats
just don't bear out the theory that the Scandinavian is some disreputable
byway. The opening is legit and here to stay. When you take it up, you
discover a mysterious woman you simply fail to fathom, yet still love.}) *

{Our Great Hurdle:} 1. -- {In the position, we have little to no margin for
error. Our defence must be comp-perfect or we face Old Testament style divine
retribution. We cover this line and its offspring in Chapters Two, Three and
Four. It represents no less than an attempt at total eclipse of the ...Qd6
lines and constitutes an existential threat to our very survival. So study
these chapters as if your life depends upon it - because it does! If you do
study these chapters carefully, you discover that your resources are more than

nowhere after} Bf6 {.}) 25... Rf6 26. g4 Rh6 {Here Lasker's scheming mind
began to weigh the pros and cons of a psycho sac.} 27. Qxh6 $2 {Warfare, by
its very nature, offers each side license to inflict savage acts upon the
other, which would be deemed criminal in times of peace. Chaos asserts itself.
Out of nowhere, the queen materializes on h6, as if beamed down by Scotty
himself, from the USS Enterprise. She plunges into the murky depths, without
thought of retreat or mercy, in a final defiant act of a defiant life. One can
never accuse Lasker of an impoverished imagination, and the shocking effect of
this move is the equivalent to President Obama delivering a State of the Union
speech wearing sandals, shorts, a Bob Marley t-shirt and dreadlocked hair -
and his new wardrobe's effect on the New York Stock Exchange the following day.
--- QUESTION: I don't understand. Isn't this sac, to put it mildly, a bit on
the rash end of the scale? Is it madness or veiled calculation? --- ANSWER:
Perhaps a little of both. Clearly the move courts death. The sac unleashes one
of Lasker's shady yet maddeningly difficult to refute ideas. In a sense, there
is no basis for understanding, since Lasker sometimes deliberately chose "bad"
moves to confuse his often confused adversaries, as he attempts in this
instance. His sac is more an article of faith in his own remarkable
calculation abilities, rather than from logic or empiricism. Lasker rejected
truisms in chess and confounded many an opponent this way. His philosophy: It
is simple to put forth difficult and even unsound obstacles in an opponent's
path; much more difficult, however, is the actual refutation of the problems
by the defence. --- Lasker just can't help himself from such extemporaneous
indulgences, especially in a simul game, when he is in no mood for manoeuvring
niceties. Technically, the move is an error, but if Lasker plays it, maybe it
isn't an error! Presumptions are sometimes misinterpreted as facts. Now the
gates of hell open around Black's king. Tormented shadows and spirits, pulsing
and vibrating with life, writhe in terrible images which labour to take form
and come to life in the corporeal realm of materiality. Lasker's idea comes
tantalizingly close to fulfilment, but in the end, the key simply fails to fit
the lock.} ({With hindsight, Lasker should have played the prosaic} 27. Qg2 {
, but then we would have been deprived of a very interesting game.}) 27... gxh6
{Capture of the queen is no cause for rejoicing just yet. Black feasts
sombrely, realizing the food consumed may also be poisoned, since ingress into
the black king's inner sanctum will not be denied to White, who concedes a
dear price for the rights. Over the board it isn't such an easy matter to
navigate Black's side without capsizing one's equilibrium.} 28. gxf5+ Kf8 (

Threat: Rg8+ mating. Lasker cunningly advances in dispersed formation, coming
at Black on all sides. --- QUESTION: Did Lasker succeed in whipping up
compensation for his sacrifice? --- ANSWER: More or less, but mainly less! He
doesn't get enough. The high priest on a3 appears terrifyingly magnificent
behind the Aztec war mask, yet, somehow, the blandness of his actual face
seeps through.} Rd6 $1 {The only move, but a good one. In such positions,
stasis is an illusion. Either you gain ground or lose it.} 33. f5 b5 $1 {Idea:

undertaking continues its dreary decline to mediocrity and the proximate
success of White's dreams recede with each move. Lasker's gamble failed and
White's success seems contingent upon Black's level of confusion, which thus
far has been non-existent. --- EXERCISE (combination alert): Find a trick to

the misadventure with good grace and resigns, seeing Black's position laden
with bounty. The moral of this game: Sometimes crass consumerism and the
accruing of wealth really is the way to inner peace and happiness! ---

up with a clear path to Black's victory.} ({ANSWER: The cockroach on f4 peers

1. e4 d5 {QUESTION: Don't we violate principle right from the starting gate by
indulging in an early queen excursion? --- ANSWER: Please see my lengthy
monologue on this topic in the introduction! As I mention there, the Scandi
should be unsound, but by the caprice of some chess god or goddess, it just
isn't, and remains perfectly sound - although I can't give you the reason for
its soundness if my life depended on it!} (1... c6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4

QUESTION: If the position is destined to be Caro-Kann-like, then why not just
go ahead and play the real Caro-Kann? --- ANSWER: This is a facsimile of the
positions we reach from the Caro. But if you play the Caro, you must also face
the Advance Variation, the Panov-Botvinnik and about a half-dozen others, all
different from one another and all loaded up with nearly a century of theory.
The Scandinavian avoids such a theoretical nuisance. We tend to get the same
mainline Caro structure over and over. Also, most 1 e4 players are heavily
booked up on the Caro, and anything but booked up against the rarely played
Scandinavian.} 3. Nc3 Qd6 ({QUESTION: Are we covering} 3... Qa5 {lines as well

Everyman remains irrational in its insistence that my books remain under 1,000
pages. 3...Qa5 was my main Scandi for about two decades, but in the last few
years I added the ...Qd6 lines. --- QUESTION: What is the difference between
the two lines? --- ANSWER: Black's queen runs the gauntlet in both variations,
but to my mind, there is less danger for her in the 3...Qd6 lines. I think
White extracts an edge against the 3...Qa5 lines with an early Bd2. I haven't
yet found a path to full equality there. So in essence, my heart is with 3...

nothing to fear? --- ANSWER: Basically, we should be able to equalize after
any of White's seven non-critical, sixth-move responses in this chapter. ---
QUESTION: What is White's idea behind his last move? --- ANSWER: Essentially
he wants to cut out ...Bg4, but there is more to it. If Black develops his
bishop to f5, White's may want to keep g4 attacking options open as well.} Bf5
{Well, our choice between g4 or f5 development was made quite simple for us in

play for a win, one must sometimes take on reasonable risk as well. I think
this rare but ambitious move, designed to take over both the initiative and
bishop-pair, is White's only real try for an edge, and if failing that, then
at least a sharp fight.} ({Alternatives:} 7. Bd3 Bxd3 8. Qxd3 Nbd7 9. Bg5 e6

outwardly! One can easily become a captive in the drive to find the perfect
move each turn. Sometimes it's just better to cross your fingers and guess.

us in the Scandinavian? --- ANSWER: I freely admit that the situation looks
eerily close to one of those Morphy versus the Duke and Count bloodbaths we
all played over as kids. Zero development and Black's only developed piece
happens to be his king. But remember, this isn't a one-sided equation: 1 We
are in an ending. --- 2. There is no forced mate and Black remains up a ton of
material. So there is heavy pressure on White as well. Houdini assesses at
'=+', an edge for Black. So for the sake of argument, let's grant Black the

--- Summary: Prepare yourself for the upside down, alternate reality, also
known as the Scandinavian, where development is optional, and Dukes and Counts
smack down Morphy. Having gone over this game, it feels like White did
everything right and Black did everything wrong, yet the forces of chaos won
anyway. For some reason, I am reminded of Bill Clinton's assertion that he
"didn't inhale" when reflecting deeper on this game.} 0-1

would White post his bishop on e2 when d3 or c4 is open? --- ANSWER: This is a
question I also ask myself! White's choice may be disgustingly passive, but
essentially there is nothing wrong with it. Equality, which our opponents hand
to us on a shiny platter, is not the issue. But if we are playing for a win
against a lower-rated player, determined not to lose, then matters are not so
easy for Black. --- QUESTION: Do we play our bishop out to g4 or f5 in this
case? --- ANSWER: In this instance, either one is fine. In fact I play both.
--- QUESTION: So how does one go about winning from such sterility? --- ANSWER:
The answer is to relax, don't push too hard for the win and cultivate patience.
Just keep one eye open for a place to create a favourable imbalance later on.

before you if you remain alert. Now a period of strained silence ensues with

hitting a wall on d5. Somehow, this line lacks dynamism for White.} Bg4 {
QUESTION: Is there some rule of thumb to pick ...Bf5 or ...Bg4? It seems to
alternate from game to game. --- ANSWER: The reason it alternates from game to
game is that in most cases both are playable. I tend to prefer ...Bg4 and then
eventually chop the f3-knight. A white knight on e5 gets me a lot more nervous
than the loss of the bishop-pair. As mentioned before in this chapter, I don't
consider loss of the bishop-pair a negative in such a rigid structure. In fact,
I often rely on this imbalance to play for a win versus lower-rated players

move, and therefore one which you may face often at club level, especially if
your opponent doesn't know any Scandinavian theory (my guess is 90% of all
your opponents!). --- QUESTION: Why isn't it played more often at a higher
level? --- ANSWER: The bishop simply hits a wall after Black plays ...e6, so
it's questionable if it's posted on the correct diagonal. Secondly, the 6 Ne5
lines, which we examine in the next three chapters, are so scary for Black
that there really is no question which line poses the most danger to the ...Qd6 Scandinavian. There is something mild and nondescript about the 6 Bc4 line.
Essentially, the move oozes neutrality, and therefore, by proxy also tacit
equality.} Bg4 {Black's best response. --- QUESTION: What about posting the
bishop on f5?} ({ANSWER: I would stay away from f5 in this instance. White

and into your hands.}) ({QUESTION: If White challenges us with} 7. h3 {then
should we grab the pawn with} Bxf3 8. Qxf3 Qxd4 {? --- ANSWER: I would. White
gets compensation, but we Scandi folk, as mentioned in the first game of this
chapter, are a greedy lot! Think of the suffering Tiviakov was willing to
endure for material in the first game of the chapter. He would most certainly
grab the pawn and hang on to it for dear life in comp-like style. So maybe we
should follow suit. Practice such positions against the comps at home, taking
White and learn how the comps defend Black. This prepares you for the real
thing when it comes across over the board in a tournament game. After} 9. Bb3

dynamic bone in my body, and underestimate White's compensation, but I would
take Black in a flash, with the expectancy of survival and conversion in such
a position.}) 7... Nbd7 ({QUESTION: Why not} 7... e6 {instead? --- ANSWER: We
talked about this point earlier in the chapter in a similar situation. I feel
it is the most accurate way to play Black, who clamps down on any Ne5 notions
from White, basically his bread and butter theme in such positions.}) 8. h3 Bh5

White holds the edge due to his bishop-pair and greater central space, O.
Kauppila-J.Parkkinen, Espoo 2004. --- QUESTION: When do we take and when do we
play ...Bh5? --- ANSWER: It varies from variation to variation, so there is no
pat answer, and in the end, the decision is often stylistically formulated.
Also, this is where your judgement comes in. It improves as you play more
Scandinavians and accrue experience. --- Here are some points to think about
when playing ...Bxf3: 1. We hand over the bishop-pair. --- 2. But keep in mind,
in such structures this doesn't always constitute an advantage for White,
since the structure for now remains rigid, benefiting our side. --- 3.
Exchanging on f3 also veers the position along strategic lines. --- When
playing ...Bh5: 1. White usually plays g4, perhaps followed by Ne5 or Nh4. ---
2. This sharpens the game considerably and tactics likely come to the
forefront. --- 3. White gains space, possibly also heightened attacking
chances. --- 4. White also risks overextension.}) 9. Qe2 (9. g4 Bg6 10. Nh4 e6

what seems to be a rather pleasant-looking Caro-Kann. --- QUESTION: What makes
this a good Caro for Black? --- ANSWER: White's c3-knight normally locates on
the superior g3-square in a Caro. In this instance, it sits awkwardly on c3
for a couple of reasons: 1. By sitting on c3, this in a strange sense turns
White's d4-pawn into a virtual isolani since c3 isn't available. I have picked
off that vulnerable d-pawn many, many times in Scandinavians. --- 2. Once
again, the out-of-sync c3-knight provides Black opportunities for ...Bb4 and ...Bxc3, just as Tiviakov does in his game against Lahno in the next chapter.}

White agrees to deterioration to her structure in an attempt to untangle.} ({

to an ending, or even a late middlegame, we are likely to make White pay
dearly for his radical decision. I think our odds are good in achieving just
that.} ({A safer, duller course for White would be} 9. Qe2 Bg6 $1 {(a swap of

question of Black as well. White's last move was the nuclear option. His own

certain to fall under attack, no matter where he goes or doesn't go. What need

Part of the magic of chess is the fact that two strong players with equal IQ
levels and chess ability can examine a position and come to opposite
conclusions on an assessment. Most strong players may look at the diagrammed
position above and tell you Black is in serious trouble. After all, White
leads in development in a somewhat open position. We Scandinavian players know
better, and I state with confidence, mainly based on GM Tiviakov's games:
Black holds his own. --- The next three chapters, all stemming from the
exceedingly dangerous 6 Ne5 line, will be our greatest theoretical challenge
in the book. If there is a refutation to the ...Qd6 Scandinavian, then this is
it. Yet, I just don't believe in the opening's refutability, and from my
experience Black thrives surprisingly well within the admittedly hostile
environment. --- This is not a chapter we can wing. If we enter the 6 Ne5
lines under prepared, we can quickly find ourselves disoriented, unable to
swim, flailing about, instinctively attempting to grab hold of something,
anything. If we prepare well, we find that White furiously chases our queen
about, yet does little damage to the inherent stability of our position. There
is nothing tangible for White to grasp on to, except for his primal desire to
chase us about. If we deeply study our lines - from my perspective, Black
tends to know and understand the 6 Ne5 lines far better than White, since we
deal with it far more often than our opponents - then the genie, who hoped to
create havoc and mischief, gets unceremoniously stoppered in his bottle, to
lie dormant.} *

board despite the ...Nd5 threat. But is 11...Nfd5 or 11...Nbd5 actually a
threat? White intends to respond with 12 Nd6+. Work out the ramifications.
Should Black go for it or make a defensive move, negating the Nd6+ threat? ---
ANSWER: It's one thing to inadvertently do something crazy; it's quite another
to do something crazy wilfully! White's last move, although adventurous, is
also dubious and the complications favour Black, who should indeed take up the
challenge. White's last move strikes one as missing yin and an overdose of
yang! His insatiable appetite for war possibly gets the better of his good
judgement. Sometimes we lie to ourselves and then expend all our energy
working to convert the lie into the truth! In this instance, I got the feeling
that White did just that. Yet he nearly managed to turn a rather shady attack
into a terrifyingly close facsimile of the real thing by sheer force of will.
But in this instance, his demands are just too onerous for reality to fulfil,
even if he gets very real practical chances for his decision. In the next few
games, we look at the duller and far saner course of simply swapping queens,
either in this position or ones closely resembling it.}) 11... Nfd5 $1 {The
correct knight, as we shall later see. The knight eyes e3 and f4 with a glint
of greedy admiration.} ({Instead, if} 11... Nbd5 $6 12. Nd6+ Kd7 13. Nxf7 Nxe3

Nations, a body to which both warring countries passionately plead their
arguments and virtues with unabashed theatrics.}) 12. Nd6+ Kd7 13. Nxf7 Nxe3
14. fxe3 $1 {Wow, Byronic stuff. Methinks he doth sacrificeth too much, yet
this move may be White's best practical chance. I believe it was Oscar Wilde
who once wrote: "Nothing succeeds like wild excess." Dr. Frankenstein is just
sick and tired of those stupid, finger wagging
"one-dare-not-tamper-with-the-forces-of-nature!" lectures. So he defies his
critics, gathering together all the necessary parts to fashion a living,
breathing whole. --- QUESTION: Shouldn't White just be resigning? --- ANSWER:
Don't dismiss White's practical chances. His attack may be unsound, but only
if Black is a comp. We shouldn't allow ourselves to be ruled by the spirit of
mercantilism in this case. If we tally up the numbers dispassionately, then,
yes, Black up a queen for a piece, is winning as you say. But just look at
Black's position, a nightmarish, pulsing patchwork of misery, akin to strewn
wounded littering the battlefield, with the ones who are conscious all
pitifully crying for help. Such a position is not going to be so easy to
navigate, especially in a G/40, with the clock running down and taking its
toll. I am actually sympathetic to his decision due to a mitigating factor: My
friend Nikolai plays to his personal strength. My opponent has come close to
beating me several times when he managed to complicate the game, but he lost
every time when we landed in dull, strategic positions and endings, even when
on an equal footing. As the game goes, White continues his policy of
unrelenting harassment, the way one of those irritating telemarketers calls
you, hawking his unwanted wares by reading his tiresome pitch off a laminated
card from some other state.} ({No choice since} 14. Ne5+ Ke8 15. Nxg4 $4 Nxd1 {

knight, skipping and twirling in time, gestures my queen to take a seat. Her

my helpless h8-rook, if only to impress upon him just how fortunate he really
is. The position veers distinctly in the direction of bedlam, with both sides
desperately scrambling to get a bearing on the essential requirements.} ({

control over f7, e6, d5 and c4 with the proprietary air of a person determined

Black's control over d5, to possibly play d5 herself. --- 2. As we saw last

a bad position. More, she has nothing to do, whereas Black leisurely continues

inferiority, and so exudes inferiority in the present as well.} 24. h3 h4 25.

at a dismal 45%, although from admittedly a small sample, but still having
played the Caro-Kann for years, I just feel it in my bones that this position

degenerate society, comes to the conclusion that it is society, not he, who is

ANSWER: Suicide or not we must take the pawn or else White gets everything he
wanted out of the opening, namely avoidance of a queen swap, while retaining a
development lead.} Nxc4 {Played for two reasons: 1. Every swap from this point
on will be in Black's favour, since we will be up a pawn. --- 2. Black gains a

prize, mutters a prayer asking to be delivered from evil, as he proceeds with

tell: "You play anti-chess!"} 12. Bb3 e6 13. Rd1 Qb6 {QUESTION: How can Black
survive this far behind in development for only one pawn's payment? --- ANSWER:
While it is true that Black lags dangerously behind in development, he also
has one powerful factor in his favour: A lack of a clear target for White.
Black's position remains iron solid and basically White must go with the
abstract compensation of the promise of a future kingside attack, but even
that will not be so easy for him. In the matrix of attack, speed and
efficiency are two crucial elements for success - both of which White lacks at
the moment.} ({Miranda Mikadze was twice successful with} 13... Qc5 $5 {which

Qf3 Nb6 9. Ne5 {QUESTION: Why would White refuse to gain a tempo by posting
his bishop to f4? --- ANSWER: We saw in earlier games the havoc Black's ...Qd7
and ...Qg4! manoeuvre caused, so White reasons there is no rush for the
tempo-gain. He takes care of business first, preparing to castle long and only
then will he play Bf4 which isn't running away. In essence, White's last move
prevents the dreaded ...Qd7.} Be6 {Practiced familiarity is synonymous with
masterful control. Tiviakov knows and understands this line better than anyone
else in the world and doesn't get confused by White's tricky move order. He
discourages the coming Bc4. Remember, always be flexible about ...g6 and ...Bg7 development. We look at the fianchetto lines later in the book, which will
actually help you understand this and other chapters better as well, since in
some cases we do fianchetto our dark-squared bishop.} 10. Bf4 Qd8 {QUESTION:
Why isn't Black getting blown away? So far he moved his queen three times to
end up where she started from. --- ANSWER: You just described the great Zen
koan of the Scandinavian. I can't explain why Black is able to survive, other
than he just does! Perhaps the reason is twofold: 1. White has great
difficulty in opening the position in the Scandinavian. This in turn, has a
way of dampening his impressive development lead. --- 2. The second reason
lies perhaps within the psyche of many who face Scandi as White: They act like
they are winning when they actually are not. The net result of this is
overextension, which happens to White on a regular basis in the Scandi.} 11.

you too can pull this one off on an unsuspecting opponent. Let's do an
exercise here: EXERCISE (combination alert): White's most natural last move is
in reality a big blunder which drops a pawn for zero compensation. What would

point. Black removes queens from the board, and as we all understand by now,
this means he achieves equality as well.} 13. Qxc2 Bxc2 14. Ne5 $5 e6 15. Nd3 {
Perhaps White hopes to bag the bishop-pair, which probably doesn't hurt Black
at all. In fact, if I played Black against a lower-rated player, I would be
happy to chop White's knight, just to attain an imbalance.} Na4 16. Bd1 Bxd3
17. Bxa4 O-O-O 18. O-O-O Bc4 {QUESTION: I agree that Black achieved equality,
but how does one win such a position from Black's side? --- ANSWER: It isn't
easy. Caro-Kann players face this dilemma as well when they achieve sometimes
arid equality. The trick is to cultivate patience and superior endgame
technique. In this game, Ni Hua gives a terrific demonstration of how to take
down an unambitious lower-rated player, whose heart's desire is basically to
score the draw.} 19. Bb3 Bd5 {If White swaps on d5, he hands Black the
superior remaining bishop. Not much to go on, I admit, but it constitutes
progress.} 20. f3 {Threatening c4.} b5 $1 {Almost imperceptibly, Black begins
to make headway on the light squares.} 21. Kc2 Kb7 22. a4 a6 23. Bxd5 {White
tires of the waiting game.} Rxd5 {The superior recapture.} ({QUESTION: Can
Black play for a queenside minority attack with} 23... cxd5 {? --- ANSWER:
That is possible, but I have found that the minority attack is less effective
with knights off the board. In this case White isn't even worse after} 24. axb5

on the correct colour: Opposite of the remaining bishop. --- QUESTION: I have
heard this principle, but why is it important? --- ANSWER: When you own a
single bishop, it covers only one colour. By switching the colour of your
pawns, you increase your influence on your weak colour.} 30. R5e4 {White is
content to await Black's attempt to win.} h5 31. Bg3 ({If dullness is the goal,
then} 31. Bg1 {constitutes the more accurate waiting move.}) 31... b4 $1 {
Black seizes his chance to create a small imbalance while White twiddles his

36. Bf4 $2 {White pulls a 180 and strives for the win, despite the sense that
there lies a wide gulf between desire and the fulfilment of the wish. White's
rook gazes up at e6 with the floating eyes of a devotee before his goddess.
Suddenly White gets ambitious, going after e6, a move born of an ambitious
psyche, who seeks in anarchistic fashion, to disrupt. For so long, White
fought for the draw, but now, gripped by a turbulent aspiration, he goes for
the compelling desire for the win.} ({Instead, he should be content with} 36.
Bg7 {and dare Black to make progress.}) 36... cxd4+ 37. Kb2 {EXERCISE 
(combination alert): It looks as if e6 is doomed. It isn't. How can we utilize
tactics to complete the delicate transaction? --- ANSWER: Discovered attack.}

After a brief hiatus, the two sides squabble over rights to d4. White, having
been robbed of a pawn, seeks indemnifying compensation in the form of piece
activity. Why is it we all spend large portions of our chess games attempting
to extricate ourselves from the consequences of our own previous folly? White
realizes matters have gone awry and switches to full damage-control mode.})

once wilting activity feels the refreshing renewal of life energy, as rain
drops begin to patter off its leaves. This indomitable rook remains unwavering

scripture, keeping his rook annoying and active at all times.} 45. Rg4 f6 46.

the better for Black.} 18. Rxd1 {QUESTION: This is ridiculous. It looks as if
a complete beginner plays the black pieces. How can Black be okay here? ---
ANSWER: Well, the complete beginner drew with a world champion playing this
way. Be careful or I may erupt in another lengthy lecture on the fact that the
Scandinavian, as if a visitor from a parallel universe, fails to operate under
normal laws of chess physics. Just look at the diagram! It does indeed look
like Black should resign, as it appears he desperately clings to life. Yet,
Sage Houdini, in its marvellous silicon wisdom, correctly assesses it at even
- in fact, at 0.00! Fritz obstinately continues to contradict and assesses
with advantage to Black.} h5 $1 {There is his favourite ...h5 move again, but
this time it is very effective, in fact, dual purpose: 1. Tiv gets Anand
nervous about queen swaps on g4. --- 2. Black prepares to engage his sleeping
rook via, of all places, h6!.} 19. Qd3 {The Rottweiler strains her tether to
the snapping point, salivating wickedly in the direction of d8. When in doubt,
nothing lifts the spirits like the threat of a cheap, one move mate. The
threat which was once only implied, is now openly expressed. White continues
to chase the attack, as a schizophrenic would the chimera of false reality,
while jettisoning reality itself. Believe it or not, there just is no attack
here, despite all the self-evidence pointing to the contrary.} Qc8 $1 {Black's
queen is content to sway dreamily within her king's embrace. Tiv takes his
previously wild spirit of adventure and tames it into the practical. White,
despite his massive surfeit of development, finds nothing to attack! What is
more irritating to him is the fact that Black's clear lack of contrition,
coupled with imagined, mocking laughter for past misdeeds, ring hollow to
White's burning ears. The Taoist sage Lao Tzu asked: "Do you have the patience
to wait until your mind settles and the water is clear?" Black swims laps in a
cryptic pulse between taking action and waiting. The difference between the
queens' power is starkly manifest: One has nothing and wants nothing; the
other has everything but is dissatisfied, desiring even more.} ({QUESTION: Why

broken record, but do we actually some day get to develop a piece or two
besides the queen in the Scandinavian? --- ANSWER: By now you should realize
we Scandi denizens are above the law. The key factors to why this position is
equal rather than crushing for White are: 1. White, despite his massive
development lead, has trouble opening the position. --- 2. White has trouble
nailing down a concrete target from Black's side. White's fearsome pieces lack
anything to focus on to vent their pent up aggression. We witness this
bewildering Scandi phenomenon again and again in multiple games, just from
this book. The positions simply look lost for Black, when in reality the
assessment may be closer to even. This often leads overconfident opponents to
plunge off the cliff, chasing an attack which just may not be there, as we see
White do in this game. --- 3. Let's not forget: White is still down a pawn and
also has an inferior pawn structure. All Black has to do is to survive the
next dozen or so moves and he may stand clearly better. --- 4. The existence
of numbers 1, 2 and 3 mean that all swaps are poison for White and desirable
for Black. So this means Black may in essence bully White with the threat of
trade, as he does later in this game.} (15... e6 16. Rhg1 {doesn't look as

that Black tries to commit suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning by running his

car! Houdini's assessment: 0.09 - essentially dead even! I actually prefer

upon a suicidal decision. For Mastro, the miracle occurred. His hopeless
prayers for victory were suddenly granted in profusion by a powerful, hidden

we should grab White's a-pawn as Tiviakov did in this game. His position looks
fine if he plays ...Be7, rather than 17...e5!? as played in the game. Also,
regard 'freeing' pawn breaks with deep suspicion in situations where our side

The bishop tacks, weaves and sails on gusts of optimism, severing the
connection between black's queen and f7, but at a high price. --- QUESTION: Is
this move sound? --- ANSWER: Just barely, if at all. The bishop inhales valour,
while exhaling contradiction. I can't help but think the move works against
White's self-interest, a bit like if McDonalds, Burger King, Kentucky Fried
Chicken and other fast food purveyors of clogged arteries waged an advertising
campaign featuring happy heart attack victims and morbidly obese actors.
White's last move is a new idea in the position and has all the hallmarks of a
prepared line, designed to confuse your easily confused writer. But in the end,
I feel White struggles for equality. --- QUESTION: If this is true, then why
not give your opponent a '?!' mark after his move? --- ANSWER: The move may be
dubious under Houdini's glaring light, but remember, his move is also a
theoretical novelty, which compels Black to find the correct path over the
board, which is not so easy, especially in a G/40. So his move certainly
contains the seed of practical chances.} Qe4+ 10. Qe2 {The only move.} Qxf4 {

he also faces the spectre of overextension. The e5 point is White's holy grail,

similar anticipatory stress. --- QUESTION: What is so scary about White's last

most dangerous variable of the 6 Ne5 mainline. Black has resources but must

is time wasted. With his last move, White nods his head in assent to a

something just as bad: underextension! It is very easy to get pushed off the

can't be fixed with another weakening move!} Nh5 $5 {QUESTION: This looks
incorrect. Why decentralize when d5 is available? --- ANSWER: I actually like
this rare idea and was tempted to give the move an exclam. There is sound
reasoning behind the decentralization: 1. White's last move, although seizing
space, also created a gaping hole on f5. Black plans an eventual ...Ng7 and ...Nf5 to occupy the hole. --- 2. If he plays the knight to d5, as we saw last
game, it just gives White invitation to continue the chase with c4 and c5, all
with tempo, just as Shirov played last game. --- 3. Why duplicate and play to
d5 when Black's b6-knight can do so?} 10. Be2 {QUESTION: Doesn't this move
gain a tempo? --- ANSWER: Not if Black wanted to be chased to g7. Remember, h5
is just a rest stop, not the final destination.} ({White can also challenge
the h5-knight with the following manoeuvre:} 10. Ne4 Qc7 11. Ng3 Ng7 12. Qe2

new home on f5. --- QUESTION: I concede that Black controls f5 - but little
else! Isn't he just getting squeezed? --- ANSWER: There is a chance of that
happening, but I actually prefer Black, due to future possibilities of White
overextending. It feels to me like White's alleged advantage in space is
without substance, and for now, unable to convert to anything more tangible.
But I also realize this is a tough argument to sell.} 13. Qd3 h5 $5 {QUESTION:
Why did Black toss in this move? --- ANSWER: He probably wanted to deny White
access to the g4-square.} ({I would play} 13... h6 {instead, to open the
h-file and activate the h8-rook.}) 14. Bd2 Bg7 15. O-O $5 {QUESTION: Is it
safe for White to castle kingside with the kingside so breezy? --- ANSWER: I
tend to agree with you that it looks safe enough for now, but of course he
must remain vigilant for future infiltration attempts. The reason White's king
may castle kingside is the principle: The cramped side should not attack.
Black simply lacks the space and activity to get at White's king, for now. But
in chess, as in life, things change, and later Black does indeed whip up an
attack. The alternative is to castle long, but in that case, Black's king
looks quite safe on the sealed kingside and Black can slowly try to build for
a queenside attack.} O-O 16. Nc5 {In order to deny Black ...Be6 ideas.} Qc7 17.

solid and full of future counterattack potential.} Nd7 {Principle: The cramped
side should seek exchanges.} 18. Ncxd7 Bxd7 19. a5 {QUESTION: Is it worth
considering swapping on d7 and grabbing the bishop-pair? --- ANSWER: I doubt
it. White's entire game revolves around the strength of his e5-outpost. Also,
every swap benefits Black, the cramped side.} Rfd8 {Black may be preparing a ...c5 freeing break.} 20. b4 {He reads his opponent's mind and immediately
clamps down on the c5-square. Still, Black may slowly be able to work it in
with ...b6 first.} e6 21. Bf3 Be8 {Black's light-squared bishop hobbles about,

more exposed White's king looks.} 27. bxc5 $6 ({White gets a better version of
the game's continuation after the correct} 27. dxc5 Bxe5 $1 28. fxe5 Bc6 {.})
27... Bxe5 $1 {Great judgement. The e5-knight's once formidable coercive
powers fade away. No longer is he able to intimidate. Black eliminates White's
best piece and sees that his weakening is in reality just cosmetic. ---
QUESTION: Why? Black's last move looks like an awful strategic decision which
punctures his dark squares. --- ANSWER: Those dark squares are only weak if
White's pieces and especially his dark-squared bishop get easy access to them,
which they don't, mainly because White's g- and e-pawns block avenues of entry.
} 28. fxe5 Bc6 $1 {The once introverted bishop inveigles his way into White's
camp. A swap of light-squared bishops sucks dry the remainder of White's life
force, to leave a husk rather than a corpse of the remaining bishop on d2.
Following two principles: 1. When the opponent has the bishop-pair, eliminate
one of them. --- 2. Force your opponent's pawns on the same colour as his
remaining bishop. White's alleged powerhouse, his dark-squared bishop, begins
to see that his reputation far outstrips his actual abilities.} 29. Bxc6 ({No

queen to step aside, in dangerously understated, unspoken menace.}) 29... Qxc6

believes himself insulated from the outside world. The power differential
between knight and bishop is self-evident.} 30. Ra6 $2 {The rook, needed for
defence, goes off on his own little adventure. Now the light squares sag and
collapse, leaving White's king vulnerable and demoralized. His position
shudders.} ({His best chance to hang on lay in a line like} 30. Be1 {,

with this picture? Few openings are more generative of irony and pure,

--- QUESTION: A bold sac or a case of ambition exceeding practicality? Is the
sac really effective? It just looks like White gave away a pawn for nothing.
--- ANSWER: The assassin's fundamental goal is to seek out and eliminate the
target. How he does so is immaterial. The cryptic decision to sac does, indeed,
look that way to the naked eye, but computer analysis proves it absolutely
sound. The sac's effectiveness is partially contingent upon Black's degree of

Alekhine's Defence from hell! --- ANSWER: Hang in there. At this stage the
half-fullness or half-emptiness of Black's glass remains inconclusive. Matters
are not as clear cut as they appear. Remember, White pushed pawns and created
holes, like on f5, all at the cost of potential overextension. There is also

us both up! But the lines are rather knotted and difficult to find. For a

around in this line, playing every Black sub-variation. --- QUESTION: Why

speculate. That said, I also like Tiv's move. The Scandinavian should be fun,
and not just taken as medicine to relieve opening pains. The spirit of

Warholian, innate ability to be at the centre of conversation when he enters
the room.} d5 {Practicing what I preach, even with a national title on the
line and against a GM. I apologize for slipping this rather insipid draw into
the book, but it's a good example of how to keep at bay a very strong opponent
with the Scandi. I promise to add another game with this line (a real game
this time, not a 17-move draw) next in the book.} 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qd6 4. d4
Nf6 5. Bc4 {In the hotel bar after the game, Walter confessed he basically
smelled a rat and decided to avoid the ultra-sharp, ultra-theoretical 6 Ne5
lines (the mean spirited Chapters 2, 3 and 4 in this book), adding he didn't
feel confident enough to trot it out in an important game. Moral: The Scandi
is a supremely practical choice. Even GMs don't know the Scandinavian as well
as they would a mainstream, blue-blooded brother or sister opening, like the
King's Indian, or Najdorf Sicilian. --- QUESTION: Isn't White's last move
actually his most natural move on the board? --- ANSWER: It is if you don't
know the 6 Ne5 theory! As mentioned in the introduction to this book, in my
opinion the 6 Ne5 lines are White's only theoretical threat for the
Scandinavian player. All others should allow Black comfortable equality if we
understand and are familiar with the theory (and since you possessed the
brilliant judgement and foresight to purchase this delightful and instructive
book, you do know the theory!).} c6 6. Nge2 {QUESTION: Why place the knight on
the passive e2-square rather than centralize it further on f3? --- ANSWER: On
e2, White's knight serves a dual function: 1. White prepares to gain yet
another tempo on Black's queen with a coming Bf4. --- 2. White can even play
for the plan Ng3, f4 and f5, prying open the f-file and opening the game to
assist his superior development.} Bf5 {QUESTION: Is the g4-square an option to
provoke f3?} ({ANSWER: It is and Tiviakov tried it. Essentially, we allow
White the free move f3. --- QUESTION: Does f3 help or hurt White? --- ANSWER:
Both. f3 helps if White plays the manoeuvre Ng3 and Ne4. Now if we play
something like ...Nxe4 in response, White can recapture with his f-pawn,
opening the f-file and also strengthening his central control. On the down
side, if White is induced into f3, he can't make use of the f3-square for his
queen as Browne did in this game, and the move also weakens the e3-square. ---

custom at the board, was way behind on the clock, 11 minutes to my 20 and
quaking. He offered a draw which allowed us to share first place in the
tournament, so I quickly took up his offer. White's forces, wafting for so
long in reverie on past glories and dreams of a sunny future, now come face to

Overly ambitious? --- ANSWER: It's a tricky matter to dangle the bobble of
temptation before an unpredictable force. Wishing and determined effort are
not enough to mend and alter destiny's stubborn dictates. In this instance,
loyalty to one's initiative doesn't win returned fealty from the object of
trust. White places more faith in his attacking chances than the actual
reality of the position is willing to return. White points his gun and fires.
Unfortunately for him, the target, Black's king, is a hologram. White takes
refuge in that eternally comforting narcotic: The attack. But to attack, one
first needs a stable target. In this case Black refuses to cooperate, sending
his king in the other direction. White's last move certainly is ambitious,
perhaps borderline reckless, especially since Black hadn't yet committed to
kingside castling.} O-O-O $1 {Black adds pressure to White's d-pawn and asks

1. e4 d5 2. exd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3 Qd6 4. d4 Nf6 5. Bd3 {QUESTION: Why develop the
bishop to d3, rather than the more aggressive c4-square? --- ANSWER: White
reasons that Black will probably castle kingside. If this is the case, he
wants his bishop to aim directly at h7, rather than post it on c4, where it
stares at a wall on e6. --- QUESTION: So are you saying the move is more
accurate than playing to c4? --- ANSWER: No. The d3 posting contains a problem
as well: d4, although not hanging, has been weakened. Black takes full
advantage of this with his next move.} Nc6 $1 {Target: d4.} ({Of course the
d-pawn isn't really hanging.} 5... Qxd4 $4 6. Bb5+ {drops the queen.}) 6. Nge2

remain on the board, even if queens are off. Also, Black has something

lacks meaningful counterplay.} b5 $1 11. Bb3 a5 {Black generates a queenside

clearly in a downward spiral and continues to drift rudderless, unable to
formulate an unravelling plan.} 14. Ba2 $6 {QUESTION: What is the point of
White's last move? --- ANSWER: I don't have a clue. White needs to bring
something, anything, out.} ({I would go for something like} 14. Bf4 O-O 15. Ne3

also forget lines. This seems to be the case for the introverted bishop.

conflicted fealties between cautious restraint and outright passivity, and his
demoralized defenders sit around in glum apathy.} Nc4 $1 {Black's forces stare

recapture away from the centre? --- ANSWER: He allows White a healthy
queenside pawn majority and inflicts upon himself a crippled kingside majority,

Lopez, which goes 1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 Bb5 a6 4 Bxc6. Now, isn't Black doing
exactly the same thing (capturing away from the centre to free his position)

about the ...c6 lines is not that they are unsound, but that they tend to veer
toward the overly solid, and therefore can be very difficult to win as Black.
So to alleviate this issue, a sharper, little studied sideline is offered: 5...
g6. In Alekhine's Defence/Grünfeld fashion, we hand White the centre, with the
understanding that eventually we strike back with either: 1. Direct piece
pressure on White's d-pawn with ...Nc6, ...Rd8, ...Bg4 and ...Bxf3. This plan
tends to be more effective when White tries Nb5 and c4 lines, which undermine
his c3 support for the d4-pawn. --- 2. Black plays for a ...c5 break, but only
when we catch up with White in development. We all understand not to open the
position when behind in development in the Scandinavian! --- 3. We play for an
...e5 break, sometimes with ...Bg4 and ...Bxf3 tossed in, to weaken White's
control over e5, at the cost of the bishop-pair, which rarely scares the
seasoned Scandinavian player. --- So if you are in the mood to play harder for
a win, or just desire a change (or plan wanton opening treachery upon the
opponent!), then the 5...g6 line is an interesting diversion which is almost
certain to catch your opponents off guard theoretically, after which the
recoil from our opening surprise may throw off his or her aim.} *

Your pieces look pretty passive. --- ANSWER: I admit that the disparity
between White's activity and Black's utter absence of it appears stark. With
each passing move, White's intrusions grow bolder in inverse motion to Black's
hasty retreats. Still Black, who is a pawn up, subscribes to the philosophy:
If two parties market comparable products, the one at lower cost tends to sell.
For now, the queenside is an autonomous zone, not controlled by either side,
since White exerts pressure and ties Black down to pawn weaknesses on a6 and
c6, yet is unable to regain the lost pawn. It won't be easy, but don't
underestimate the value of patience and human toil, valuable commodities in
any market. In such positions, don't be in any rush, and expect the turnaround

fulcrum for both sides in the Scandinavian. For White, it promises attacking
chances based upon a hook for Ne5, as we saw in Chapters Two, Three, and Four.

that, a target for ...c5 and ...e5 counters. But how do we respond when White
holds back on an early d4? We examine this question in this chapter. The lines
tend to be quite harmless for our side, with the possible exception of the
position:} 4. Bc4 Nf6 5. d3 c6 6. Nge2 {. This position may be a bit of
dilemma since White plans the automatic 0-0, Ng3, f4 and f5. We can simply
allow it and live with a '+=' position, or we can try Ardelean's bizarre idea
which he may have seized upon as a chance opportunity in his game against
Mihailidis. In this game White's initiative screeched and slammed to a jarring

natural spot for the bishop, yet this line fails to worry me. --- QUESTION:
Why? --- ANSWER: If you are careful and avoid some devastating sac on e6 or f7,

feels too primitive to give Black any real trouble.} Nf6 6. Qe2 {Fighting for

QUESTION: Why didn't Black develop her light-squared bishop first to g4 or f5?

common in the ...Nd7 Smyslov lines of the Caro-Kann, where Black fianchettos
the bishop with ...b6 or sometimes even ...b5, then plays for ...c5.} ({Let's

d3 {QUESTION: I don't understand the philosophical motivation of such
passivity. Why play a pawn meekly to d3, when the more aggressive and more
central d4-square is available? --- ANSWER: Everything you said was correct:
d4 is, indeed, a more aggressive square and seizes more space as well.
However, the point you didn't mention is that White's d4-pawn is also a
potential weakness and a source of Black's counterplay in Scandinavians,
especially with White's knight posted on c3, denying him the c3 stabilizing
pawn push. By holding the pawn back to d3, White in essence, deprives Black of
even a trace of counterplay, while admittedly reducing his own options as well.

Houdini thinks it's okay, but I wouldn't have played it. White receives full
mathematical value: rook and two pawns for two minor pieces. The trouble is

passive square? --- ANSWER: Such decisions are a matter of taste. One player's
passivity is another's safety. White is a 2145-rated player facing a GM, so he
basically creates a fortress and announces to his opponent: "Come and get me!"}

6. d3 {Once again White refuses to offer targets of any kind to his opponent.
Black's light-squared bishop also seems somewhat confused, looking dreamily at
the bedrock point on d3. --- QUESTION: So are you saying White stands better?

advantage. The trouble lies in if Black wants to play for a win - not such an
easy proposition.} Nbd7 7. Be3 ({QUESTION: Are we to just hand over the
bishop-pair on} 7. Nh4 {? --- ANSWER: Yes, handing over the light-squared
bishop isn't something a Scandinavian player should be afraid to do. Black's
compensation: 1. It creates bishop versus knight imbalance, in a rather (for
now) rigid structure. More often than not, the knight easily holds its own.

wants to play fianchetto lines, then he should post his knight on e2, rather
than on f3, a set-up we examine later in the chapter. --- QUESTION: What is
the difference in g3 positions with White's d-pawn on d4, and the ones where
the pawn stands on d3? --- ANSWER: Two-fold: 1. With the pawn on d4, positions
we examined earlier in the book, White stakes out more central space and gives
himself a hook to plant a piece on e5. However, the pawn on d4 can also be a
target for Black and a weakness for White. --- 2. When White plays his pawn to
d3, he deprives Black of targets, and himself of central space as well. The
positions tend to exude a reversed King's Indian flavour.} Bg4 6. Bg2 c6 {Just

White lashes out pre-emptively, despite material debt and low likelihood of
success in his risky venture. It feels almost to me like White fights secret
guilt over his 14th move. --- QUESTION: Is this sac sound? --- ANSWER: I doubt
it, but I do know this: Malevolent intent alone is insufficient reason. White
begins an abstruse plan, which, when examined deeply enough, does contain the
seed of logic, despite outer appearances. On the other hand, White's sac looks
like a temporary feel-good fix, rather than an actual attempt at a cure for
what ails him: The pathology of which points to his dubious decision on his
14th move. It isn't easy to be an addict's spouse. In the case, the e-pawn is
an enabler, allowing White free reign to follow his addiction: The initiative.}

not-so-terrifying theoretical dodges from White. The key factor we must keep
in mind is these lines shouldn't be met with the standard ...c6 and ...Bf5 or ...Bg4 plan, which we may accidentally play out of habit. Instead, e5 is the
square through which all our blessings flow, so we should opt for more
aggressive set-ups, based on ...Nc6 and ...e5!. Keep in mind also that most of
the lines in this chapter lead to more open positions than we are normally
used to in the traditional ...c6, ...Bf5 chapters, so even though you may land
equality, you may not be as comfortable with the type of equality which you
achieve. --- When our opponents avoid an early Nc3, we must be well prepared

White does kick the queen around, but only with pawn moves, not constituting
development. Black stands better due to his bishop-pair and dark-square
potential. The Scandinavian is certainly a tempo-devouring opening. Yet the

--- QUESTION: Does Black get compensation? Queens are off the board. ---
ANSWER: More than enough compensation. In fact, Black scores 54% from this
position. By grabbing the pawn at a cost to his development, White enters a
dubious marriage, derived from contradictory expectations. I realize that
'better' and 'worse' are often subject to opinion, with even world-class
players entrenched in polarities. Yet in this case, the evidence of Black's
huge compensation looks overwhelming: 1. Black leads in development, with an
open centre. This development lead grows, since White must see to the needs of
both king and e5-pawn. --- 2. White's king looks insecure. Black soon castles
long and c2 isn't a safe haven for his king either, since Black may post a
bishop on f5. --- 3. White's extra pawn remains pretty flimsy and if he tries
to hang on to it permanently with f4, he loses more time and weakens his light
squares further.} 5. Kxd1 {White's king promulgates the dubious notion that
all who swear allegiance to him will attain the kingdom of heaven in the

words, but unfortunately they were the ones uttered by Captain Ahab, the
obsessive/compulsive who risked all to chase the white whale. In this case I

White's king remains no more secure. So there is no easy path to White's now
modest goal of equality.} 9. Ke1 (9. Bg3 Bxf3+ 10. gxf3 Bd4 {regains the

but I was outed by this bugger named Michael, who saw through it and announced:
"Mrs. Kelly, that looks like the rock salt which my dad uses to melt ice and
snow on our driveway. I don't think Cyrus actually did his project! He just
grabbed a handful of rock salt and now says they are crystals." Damn him! I,
like OJ Simpson, indignantly proclaimed both my innocence and also my
chemistry prowess. --- Well, in this chapter, your opponents are like me with
my first grade chemistry project. They don't know or like Scandinavian theory

this chapter familiarizes us with the goofy non-theoretical lines.} *

1. e4 d5 2. e5 {Another not-so-impressive option. White optimistically thrusts
his e-pawn forward, hoping to establish an independent principality within
Black's borders. --- QUESTION: What is wrong with this move? White takes space,
similar to the Advance French or Advance Caro Kann. --- ANSWER: This is not
the same. With the move, White violates divine proscription: 1. In the Advance
French, Black already commits to blocking in his light-squared bishop with ...e6. In our game continuation, Black's 'bad' bishop is free to roam as he
pleases on f5 or perhaps g4, if White tosses in Nf3. --- 2. In the Advance
Caro, Black does indeed get to move his light-squared bishop outside the pawn
chain, but at the cost of a thrown-away tempo in ...c6. --- QUESTION: Why is ...c6 a wasted tempo? --- ANSWER: Black inevitably needs to challenge the centre
with ...c5 at some point or another, so having played ...c6 is a pure waste of
time with zero benefit for Black.} c5 {Black achieves ...c5 even before White
has a chance to back up his e-pawn with d4. --- QUESTION: I am not even

1. d4 d5 2. e4 {The Blackmar Diemer Gambit. --- QUESTION: Is it sound? ---
ANSWER: I would love to tell you "No! The Blackmar Diemer is a shady opening!"
except that it could cost me my life. These Blackmar Diemer guys are cult
members who worship at the alter of their opening they believe is infused with
arcane magic, and are driven into a paroxysms of rage if you even hint that
their cherished gambit is unsound. My student, Bob, has been playing it since
the early 1990's, and I have never been able to talk him off the ledge to give
up his beloved opening gambit. --- QUESTION: If they love their opening to
this degree, don't they also know it very well? --- ANSWER: Exactly! And every
time they win a 17-move game, they only crave more. Essentially, I believe the
opening can be neutralized, but we must be very careful, since we enter their
theoretical neighbourhood. So we must be well prepared. White controls, if not
actual authority or advantage, then at least a psychological elevation over
the opponent (us!). --- Emotionally, I am quite sympathetic to the
anti-establishment BDG enthusiasts out there. Your writer, like the typical
BDG player, also cultivated a peevish, uneasy relationship to those in
authority. When I was eight-years-old my mother (authority figure), seeking to
make me a good citizen, brow-beat me into joining the Cub Scouts of Canada
organization (yet more authority). I rebelled against this rude attempt at
indenture and achieved the notable distinction of earning exactly zero Cub
Scout badges in the two year period of my tenure - pretty impressive when you
consider that most of my Cub Scout buddies earned approximately a badge a
month during the same period.} dxe4 3. Nc3 ({QUESTION: Can White play the

the blocked position, I.Tjutjunnikov-V.Malaniuk, Alushta 1994.}) 8... Re8 9. h3

12. b3 $6 {Strategically suspect. I remain dubious about this plan's viability.

Black may be able to engineer a future ...d4, after which White suffers an
additional hole on b4.} ({I would temporize with} 12. Qc2 {.}) 12... Qd7 {
Bauer opts to retain central tension.} ({Another thematic Philidor idea is}

over d4)} 14. Nxd4 Nxd4 15. Bb2 {and I prefer Black.}) 13. Bb2 Rad8 14. Qb1 $5
{QUESTION: What is the idea behind this move? --- ANSWER: Apparently White
seeks to engineer b4.} Nh5 $1 {Thematic. f4 will be a juicy outpost for the
knight. By imperceptible degrees, White's position continues its degeneration
in a decaying orbit.} 15. b4 $5 {Fastidiously sticking with his hypermodern
game plan, where he seeks to undermine e5.} dxe4 16. dxe4 $6 {He may have been
better off recapturing with the knight to seek exchanges.} Nf4 $1 {The
duplicitous knight is not to be trusted. His perceptions are honed for war,
not diplomacy. Black's control over f4 turns isn't as inconsequential as White
may have believed. The attackers speak in quiet, confidential tones, all the
while surreptitiously eyeing White's king.} 17. b5 {A wisp of counterplay from
White? It looks like Black just hung his e-pawn. However, strong GMs don't
just give pawns out of a charitable nature. --- EXERCISE (planning/combination
alert): The kingside teams with arrivals, and soon, some departures. Bauer
contrives a deep attacking idea of an unbalanced poet. A key component to
Black's attack is missing. The position, pregnant with tension, reaches the
limits of tolerance before giving birth to war. Unlock the missing element and
Black's becomes supercharged. --- ANSWER: The white king's shelter is torn
away in a torrent of attackers.} Bxh3 $3 {The startled white king's mouth
forms into a large 'O' of astonishment at the turn of events. An emphatic
reminder that Black's forces are coming to town for an extended visit. The
nature of this attack is that it requires considerable investment of capital,
but Black's judgement is vindicated. Soon he recoups his losses by acquiring
rights to White's kingside.} 18. gxh3 (18. bxc6 Qg4 {leaves White curiously
helpless.}) 18... Nxh3+ 19. Kh2 {The forest traveller evades the wolf pack by
wading into a stream. But for how long can he remain in the frigid water while
the wolves patiently await on both sides for their future meal? Many of
White's defenders churlishly await on the other side of the board, refusing to
participate in the defence.} ({After} 19. Bxh3 Qxh3 {there is no reasonable
defence to a rook lift to g6.}) 19... Nf4 {An assassin is hardly likely to
balk at the taking of the second life of his c6-knight, to his mind collateral
damage, to ensure the prime target (the white king, who he regards as a blot
upon the scenery, to be expunged from the world) is terminated in the process.}

White!} 25. Rg3 Rxg3+ 26. fxg3 Qxg3+ 27. Kh1 {EXERCISE (combination alert):
Black's forces, swirling and eddying around White's king in a twisting motion,
reform their ranks, awaiting orders for a second run at the enemy. Meanwhile,
White's queen, too far away to help her king (her view of her king is obscured)
, erupts in a shrill explosion of expletives (which I am unwilling to
paraphrase in this book) at the attackers. Find a way to force mate. ---
